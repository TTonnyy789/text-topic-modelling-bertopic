That’s the takeaway from the latest Markets Live Pulse survey, which showed that roughly two-thirds of the 410 respondents anticipate a downturn in the world’s biggest economy by the end of next year. A minority of 20% of pollees even see a slump in 2023, at a time when the Federal Reserve’s own staff have ditched their recession forecast altogether. Survey respondents appear to be looking past the economy’s current resilience and anticipating further damaging ripple effects from the Fed’s 5.25 percentage points of cumulative tightening over the past 16 months. The Fed lifted its benchmark rate to the highest in more than two decades last month and Chair Jerome Powell signaled additional hikes are possible. The poll results are consistent with pricing in fed funds futures, which show traders expect the central bank to cut interest rates multiple times in 2024, by more than one percentage point in aggregate, ostensibly in response to eventual economic weakness. The upshot is that investors see value in long-term Treasuries, with yields at one point last week threatening to test the multiyear highs touched in October. As they chart their allocation choices for the year ahead, survey respondents seem to be unbowed by last week’s bond-market slide, which came against the backdrop of the Treasury’s announcement that it will boost issuance, and as Fitch Ratings downgraded US sovereign debt. Treasuries recouped some ground Friday on data showing job growth in July was less than forecast. Read More: Fitch Says Growing US Debt, Deficit Forecasts Spurred Cut Investors are likely betting that the Fed will pivot to rate cuts in 2024, making long-maturity debt attractive despite the more than 1 1/4 percentage points of yield pick-up currently available on short-dated bills. Almost 60% of Pulse participants say now is a good time to buy Treasury securities with maturities longer than seven years. Of note, 59% of the responses came in before the Fitch downgrade on Aug. 1. Still, the survey results signal a problematic backdrop for US stocks, which have roared higher in 2023, pushing the Nasdaq 100 to its best first half in history, thanks in no small part to an artificial intelligence-fueled surge. Market valuations have risen accordingly. The S&P 500 trades at a multiple of roughly 20 times earnings, where Yardeni Research data show that the 20-year average is closer to 16 times. The biggest chunk of Pulse survey respondents, 47%, say the US stock market is a bubble powered by irrational exuberance, and a quarter view it as being in a bear market rally. Meanwhile, 28% say it’s a bull market that has more room to run. Driving home the preponderance of bearish views the survey elicited, more than two-thirds of respondents say the S&P 500 is still mired in an earnings recession that has longer to run.  Another survey element underscores the complexity of the macroeconomic risks that investors must account for as they look to the year ahead. Almost three quarters of poll respondents expect core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — to either remain above 3% for the next 12 months, or to dip below that level but then rebound. It’s 4.1% now, the lowest since 2021. It’s a view that stands in contrast to both the bullish survey response on long-maturity Treasuries and to market bets on rate cuts kicking in next year. And it suggests that many expect such a severe economic downturn at some point that the Fed will be easing policy even though inflation remains elevated. Hence the worries about equities.

      "['Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. is in line for an initial public offering sooner than its founder previously imagined, reflecting the Indian startup’s whirlwind pace of growth since it started selling electric scooters in late 2021.  “I thought it would take me four to six years of revenue to go public,” Founder and Chief Executive Officer Bhavish Aggarwal said in an interview while sipping iced Vietnamese coffee in New Delhi’s bustling Connaught Place. “Now I can feel that it will be much earlier. Ola Electric has grown and matured faster than I had initially planned because the market response has been very strong.” The company, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corp. and Tiger Global Management, has become leader in India’s electric-scooter market with a 38% share. It has sold more than 239,000 electric scooters since December 2021, according to data from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles. While demand initially came from first-time scooter buyers, most of Ola Electric’s customers now are already fully-fledged converts, said 37-year-old Aggarwal, dressed in a black Nehru jacket, popularized by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and later, The Beatles. Aggarwal has ambitions to expand, with plans to unveil a motorbike by the end of this year and a battery-powered car in 2024, though the timelines may change. He also continues to consider exporting scooters to Southeast Asia, Latin America and Europe, a proposition that got waylaid because demand at home was so strong, according to Aggarwal, whose first startup, ANI Technologies Pvt., runs Ola ride-hailing operations.   Ola Cabs got as far as selecting banks for a $1 billion IPO in Mumbai, Bloomberg News reported in August 2021, but that never materialized. The company, which competes against Uber Technologies Inc., is a “profitable business for us now,” Aggarwal said in last week’s interview in Delhi. He didn’t comment on any renewed attempts to list, nor did he mention a date for a possible Ola Electric IPO. Aggarwal is building a 115-acreBloomberg Terminal battery factory in southern India, pitting him against billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd., with the aim of making lithium-ion cells primarily for Ola Electric vehicles, as well as potentially offering energy storage and home energy solutions. Manufacturing EV components in-house will help Ola Electric sell cars on a bigger scale and increase margins, said Aggarwal, who graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai. Designing vehicles from scratch will give the company more control of quality and costs in a market where most EVs are converted from gasoline models, he said.  Achieving success in electric cars won’t be easy. Combustion-engine vehicles remain the favored mode of personal transport in India and dominate the country’s roads. EVs have been held back by the country’s lack of charging facilities and their high price tags. Nationwide sales reached 49,800 last year, just 1.3% of the 3.8 million passenger vehicles sold, according to BloombergNEF. Bengaluru-based Ola Electric is up against more experienced manufacturers such as market leader Tata Motors Ltd., Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and even Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc., which is considering investing in India. Ola Electric’s scooter business has also been affected by delivery delays due to chip shortages, and issues with quality and fireBloomberg Terminal. Sales slid 39% in June from previous month to 17,590 units, a trend that affected other automakers too after the government trimmed subsidies that were offered under its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles program.  Still, better technology has shortened timelines for getting a product to market, according to Aggarwal. Ola Electric uses digital simulation and artificial intelligence in manufacturing to save time. “I’m building a technology-focused group of companies,” he said. “Another big technology theme of our generation will be computing and AI. So we’ll do something.” Being a so-called flat organization also speeds up the production process, said Aggarwal, who is involved in daily decision-making at his business, which employs about 7,000 people. “What would take a month in a company, we get it done in a day,” he said. “Our philosophy on execution is that we want to do things as best as possible without any compromises on quality or safety. And do it at the lowest cost possible and the fastest speed possible.

      "['Apple’s new Vision Products Group reflects a shift away from its famed product-development process. Also: The company prepares for its fall devices, new software betas roll out, and Apple is accused of negotiating in bad faith by its first unionized retail store. Last week in Power On: The Vision Pro will take far longer than the iPad and Apple Watch to become a major revenue contributor.   When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the late 1990s, he threw away the company’s product-development playbook and shifted to a “functional” management structure. That’s why the company has no iPhone or iPad division, no AirPods group and no dedicated Mac organization. Instead, Apple is organized by departments like software engineering, hardware development, machine learning, design and services. Contributions from all those groups are then funneled into new features and products.  But Apple’s most recent new product categories, including the Vision Pro headset, show that its strategy is evolving. The Vision Pro has its own dedicated division inside of the company. The unit, run by Mike Rockwell, was dubbed the Technology Development Group, or TDG, from its inception around 2015 until the name changed in recent weeks. It’s now internally known as the Vision Products Group, or VPG. The group doesn’t depend on Apple’s main software and hardware engineering and other departments. It has its own versions of those teams, reporting to Rockwell, in addition to ones for strategy, computer vision, content, app development and project management. If the Vision products were developed in standard Apple fashion, the software engineering for the headset would have been led by Craig Federighi and his software engineering organization. The hardware would have been developed alongside Apple’s other devices under John Ternus, and the content arm would be tucked within Eddy Cue’s services empire.  That doesn’t mean the Vision Pro Group isn’t collaborating with other parts of Apple. It works with the design and operations teams overseen by Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, and the Johny Srouji-led chip unit that makes M2 and R1 processors. It also relies on frameworks and other building blocks created for iOS and macOS by Federighi’s group, which is responsible for some of the headset’s developer tools as well. And it gets a helping hand from the main hardware organization. When the Vision Pro was finally announced, people working on it believed the development team would eventually be broken up and distributed across the company — matching the approach used by Apple’s other core devices. But the recent name change seems to imply that the current structure is here to stay. I have a few possible explanations for this choice: It’s also worth noting that the unit’s new name and use of a plural in “products” seems to confirm the Vision Pro is the first of many headsets to come from Apple. As I’ve reported previously, the group is already working on a lower-cost version of the device along with a second-generation Pro model. While the Vision Pro Group puts a spotlight on this organizational evolution, this isn’t the first time that Apple has veered from its usual approach. A similar story played out for Apple’s previous new product category and is currently the case for its next major initiative.  During most of its development, the Apple Watch’s hardware and software engineering teams were placed under Williams, the COO, instead of below Apple’s senior vice presidents of hardware and software. That remains partially true today: Smartwatch software still reports to Williams, but hardware engineering has been moved under Ternus.  The company’s self-driving car team, which operates as the Special Projects Group, or SPG, is also an outlier. The unit has its own staff for software engineering, computer vision, machine learning, hardware engineering, industrial design, cloud services, project management and quality assurance. And given the complexity of building a car, that may never change.  Apple just launched new Macs, but more could be coming this fall. The company is gearing up for its busy season: It’s set to announce the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro lines in September alongside new Apple Watches. And there should be another launch in October, I’m told. The likely topic based on past history? Macs. Now that Apple has gotten the 15-inch MacBook Air and new M2 Ultra-based Macs out the door, the October launch could feature the first Macs with M3 chips. October is too early for new high-end MacBook Pros or desktops, so the first beneficiaries of the new chip should be the next iMac, 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. For those wondering about the iPad — another product that typically gets refreshed in October —  I wouldn’t expect any major upgrades until the M3 iPad Pros with OLED screens arrive next year. But an iPad Air model that boosts its specifications is also in development. Apple releases first iOS 17 public beta version and updated developer beta after security flaw discovery. With about eight weeks to go until the iPhone 15’s announcement, Apple has reached a key development stage for its latest software updates. The iOS 17 public beta is identical to the third iOS 17 developer beta from the week prior, so the public beta is mostly an indicator that Apple believes the software is now stable enough for non-developers to use. Public betas for macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10 and tvOS 17 were also released.  In other iOS news, the third developer betas were rereleased and a rapid security update for iOS 16 was issued to patch a WebKit flaw that Apple says was possibly exploited. To further complicate matters, the rapid security patch was pulled, then rereleased, after it was found to break several popular third-party apps. Even so, it’s a good reminder to update your Apple devices with security fixes as soon as possible. Apple’s first unionized store in the US says the iPhone maker is negotiating unfairly. If you’ve been following the play-by-play of the unionization efforts at Apple over the past couple of years, this shouldn’t be too surprising. The union representing Apple’s outlet in Towson, Maryland, claims that the company is negotiating in bad faith by countering demands with existing policies, showing up late to meetings, not responding to key proposals (despite the sides tentatively agreeing on about a dozen topics) and sharing updates about the talks with employees at other retail stores. The union filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board, while Apple maintains that it hasn’t done anything wrong.  Samsung Unpacked: July 26. Following its usual approach, Samsung is set to launch its latest devices in the weeks prior to Apple’s big iPhone unveiling in September. The Samsung event, called Unpacked, is likely to include the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, alongside a fresh tablet, multiple smartwatches and potentially a new version of its Galaxy Buds. The presentation gets underway at 7 a.m. New York time.Apple Quarterly Earnings: Aug. 3. The company is set to release results for the fiscal third quarter, the last three-month period before the iPhone 15 is introduced. The quarter wasn’t packed with big revenue drivers, but it did see the release of new Macs: the 15-inch MacBook Air and M2 Ultra Mac Pro, as well as the M2 Ultra and M2 Max Mac Studios. Wall Street is projecting revenue of about $81 billion, which would mark the third straight year-over-year decline. Growth is expected to resume in the coming quarters.

      "['The Israel Defense Forces have started using artificial intelligence to select targets for air strikes and organize wartime logistics as tensions escalate in the occupied territories and with arch-rival Iran. Though the military won’t comment on specific operations, officials say that it now uses an AI recommendation system that can crunch huge amounts of data to select targets for air strikes. Ensuing raids can then be rapidly assembled with another artificial intelligence model called Fire Factory, which uses data about military-approved targets to calculate munition loads, prioritize and assign thousands of targets to aircraft and drones, and propose a schedule.  While both systems are overseen by human operators who vet and approve individual targets and air raid plans, according to an IDF official, the technology is still not subject to any international or state-level regulation. Proponents argue that the advanced algorithms may surpass human capabilities and could help the military minimize casualties, while critics warn of the potentially deadly consequences of relying on increasingly autonomous systems. “If there is a mistake in the calculation of the AI, and if the AI is not explainable, then who do we blame for the mistake?” said Tal Mimran, a lecturer of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and former legal counsel for the army. “You can wipe out an entire family based on a mistake.” Details of the army’s operational use of AI remain largely classified, yet statements from military officials suggest that the IDF has gained battlefield experience with the controversial systems through periodic flareups in the Gaza Strip, where Israel frequently carries out air strikes in response to rocket attacks. In 2021, the IDF described the 11-day conflict in Gaza as the world’s first “AI war,” citing its use of artificial intelligence to identify rocket launchpads and deploy drone swarms. Israel also conducts raids in Syria and Lebanon, targeting what it says are weapons shipments to Iran-backed militias like Hezbollah. In recent months, Israel has been issuing near-daily   warnings to Iran over its uranium enrichment, vowing it will not allow the country to obtain nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Should the two enter into a military confrontation, the IDF anticipates that Iranian proxies in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon would retaliate, setting the stage for the first serious multi-front conflict for Israel since a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria 50 years ago sparked the Yom Kippur War. AI-based tools like Fire Factory are tailored for such a scenario, according to IDF officials. “What used to take hours now takes minutes, with a few more minutes for human review,” said Col. Uri, who heads the army’s digital transformation unit and who spoke at the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv on the condition that only his first name be used for security reasons. “With the same amount of people, we do much more.”  The system, these officials stressed, is designed for all-out war.  Expanding Intelligence? The IDF has long made use of AI, but in recent years it has expanded those systems across various units as it seeks to position itself as a global leader in autonomous weaponry. Some of these systems were built by Israeli defense contractors; others, like the StarTrack border control cameras, which are trained on thousands of hours of footage to identify people and objects, were developed by the army. Collectively, they comprise a vast digital architecture dedicated to interpreting enormous amounts of drone and CCTV footage, satellite imagery, electronic signals, online communications and other data for military use. Dealing with this torrent of information is the purpose of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center, run by the army’s 8200 unit. Based within the intelligence division,   that unit is where many of the country’s tech multi-millionaires, including Palo Alto Networks Inc.’s  Nir Zuk and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd founder  Gil Shwed, did their mandatory military service before forming successful startups. According to a spokesman, the Center was responsible for developing the system that “transformed the entire concept of targets in the IDF.” The secretive nature of how such tools are developed has raised serious concerns, including that the gap between semi-autonomous systems and entirely automated killing machines could be narrowed overnight. In such a scenario, machines would be empowered to both locate and strike targets, with humans removed entirely from positions of decision-making.  “It’s just a software change that could make them go to not being semi but to being completely autonomous,” said Catherine Connolly, an automated decision researcher at Stop Killer Robots, a  coalition of nongovernmental organizations that includes Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Israel says it has no plans to remove human oversight in coming years. Another worry is that the fast adoption of AI is outpacing research into its inner workings. Many algorithms are developed by private companies and militaries that do not disclose propriety information, and critics have underlined the built-in lack of transparency in how algorithms reach their conclusions. The IDF acknowledged the problem, but said output is carefully reviewed by soldiers and that its military AI systems leave behind technical breadcrumbs, giving human operators the ability to recreate their steps. “Sometimes when you introduce more complex AI components, neural networks and the like, understanding what ‘went through its head,’ figuratively speaking, is pretty complicated. And then sometimes I’m willing to say I’m satisfied with traceability, not explainability. That is, I want to understand what is critical for me to understand about the process and monitor it, even if I don’t understand what every ‘neuron’ is doing,’” said Uri.  The IDF declined to talk about facial recognition technology, which has been strongly criticized by human rights groups, although it did say it has refrained from integrating AI into recruitment software out of concern that it could discriminate against women and potential cadets from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The main advantage of integrating AI into battlefield systems, according to some experts, is the potential to reduce civilian casualties. “I think that there’s an efficiency and effectiveness benefit to using these technologies correctly. And within good functioning technological parameters, there can be very, very high precision,” said Simona R. Soare, a research fellow at the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies. “It can help you with a lot of things that you need to do on the go, in the fog of battle. And that is very difficult to do on the best of days.” “There are also many things that can go wrong, too,” she added.  Ethical Concerns While Israeli leaders have outlined their intention to make the country an “AI superpower,” they’ve been vague on the details. The Defense Ministry declined to comment on how much it’s invested in AI, and the army would not discuss specific defense contracts, though it did confirm that Fire Factory was developed by Israeli defense contractor Rafael. Further obscuring the picture is that, unlike during the nuclear arms race, when leaking details of weapons’ capabilities was a key aspect of deterrence, autonomous and AI-assisted systems are being developed by governments, militaries, and private defense companies in secret. “We can assume that the Americans and even the Chinese and maybe several other countries have advanced systems in those fields as well,” said Liran Antebi, a senior researcher at the Israel-based Institute for National Security Studies. But unlike Israel, “they have, as much as I know, never demonstrated operational use and success.” For now, there aren’t any limitations. Despite a decade of UN-sponsored talks, there is no international framework establishing who bears responsibility for civilian casualties, accidents or unintended escalations when a computer misjudges.  “There’s also a question of testing and the data that these systems are trained on,” said Connolly from the Stop Killer Robots coalition. “How precise and accurate can you know a system is going to be unless it’s already been trained and tested on people?” Such concerns are why Mimran, the law lecturer at Hebrew University, believes that the IDF should exclusively use AI for defensive purposes. During his tenure in the army, Mimran manually vetted targets to make sure that attacks complied with international law. That taught him that, regardless of technology, “there is a point where you need to make a value-based decision.” “And for that,” he said, “we cannot rely on AI.”']\n",

      "['Twitter owner Elon Musk said the company still has a negative cash flow because of its heavy debt load and a roughly 50% drop in advertising revenue. The social media site will “need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else,” Musk said in a tweet. Separately, the billionaire announced late Saturday the platform will increase the number of tweets verified accounts can see each day by 50%, following complaints from users.  Several top advertisers paused spending on the platform after Musk acquired the company last year over concerns about changes the billionaire could make. Earlier this year, Musk said that many of the advertisers who fled had returned, and that becoming cash-flow positive was imminent.  “Almost all of them have either come back or said they’re coming back,” Musk said in a Twitter Spaces in April.  Advertiser spending dropped 89% to $7.6 million over a two-month period early this year, according to estimates for market research firm Sensor Tower. The top 10 advertisers had spent $71 million on ads from September to October of 2022, ahead of Musk’s acquisition.

Some lawmakers have transitioned over to the alternative platform, but are still wary about committing to it.  Days before the launch of Threads, Twitter sparked a backlash from users after the site imposed a temporary cap on the number of tweets that accounts can see each day. The limit had initially been set at 600 of unverified users, and 6,000 for verified accounts, before eventually being lifted to 1,000 and 10,000, respectively.  The latest increase suggest verified users will now be able to see 15,000 posts, though Musk didn’t specify.   Read more: Twitter Limits Number of Tweets Users Can See Each Day  Musk purchased the social media company for $44 billion in late October 2022. He has since made several changes to the product and company structure, many of which he attributes to decreasing the company’s cash burn and debt burden.  The firm laid off thousands of employees in the wake of the deal. Among other changes, Musk introduced Twitter Blue, which allows users to verify their identity for $8 per month, and debuted ways for users to monetize their content. ']\n",

      "['Character.AI is in discussions with investors about raising an additional round of funding, The Information reportsBloomberg Terminal, citing a person with direct knowledge.  The talks come about four months after Character.AI, which allows users to create artificial intelligence–powered chatbots modeled after celebrities and historical figures, said it had raised $150 million at a $1 billion valuation. The financing may provide a cushion as the company tries to boost revenue by charging for perks, such as faster chatbot responses, with a $9.99 monthly subscription, The Information said. Registered users have climbed to 15 million since its September launch, the media outlet reported.  The company was founded by ex-Google researchers.  Scroll through TikTok in Taiwan, and you’ll find a rolling stream of videos covering the heated campaign for next January’s presidential election.  That’s making the island the next battleground in the war over political disinformation and the debate over whether China’s government can manipulate the popular app to its advantage — a concern shared in Washington ahead of the 2024 US election. TikTok isn’t the most used social media platform on the island — Facebook and YouTube have more daily visitors — and disinformation cuts across social media apps. But TikTok’s Chinese ownership and its status as the fastest-growing app is drawing scrutiny as campaigning gets underway.   “The risk level of disinformation on a platform comes from its popularity, and for TikTok, that’s only growing,” said Billion Lee, co-founder of the Taiwanese fact-checking platform Cofacts. Sensing a potential threat, authorities in Taiwan already barred TikTok from government-issued devices, in line with moves by countries including the US. Now they are weighing national security and free speech concerns before deciding whether to go further.  In a statement to Bloomberg, the company said it complies with laws and regulations wherever it works and has policies to combat disinformation and “prevent misuse of the platform.”  “We are proactively reaching out to the relevant government agencies to share how TikTok protects user data and counters misinformation,” according to the statement. That includes “confirming the authenticity of accounts of political figures and parties with the relevant individuals and organizations.” The stakes are high heading into next year’s vote. US-China tensions have soared the past year, with Taiwan often at the center of those strains. Whoever wins could help influence how that relationship evolves in the years ahead.  Why Taiwan’s 2024 Election Matters From China to US: QuickTake Given its importance to China and its ties to the US, Taiwan “has long been used as a testing ground for disinformation,” said Robin Lee, project manager of the fact-checking platform MyGoPen.  Tsai Ming-yen, the head of Taiwan’s national security bureau, said this month that his agency reviewed more than 1,800 cases of online disinformation and disputed information across several platforms, including Facebook and YouTube. He said that was 1,400 more than the same period last year and that he expected those figures to keep rising.  After TikTok was banned from government devices, some officials argued it should be barred from the island entirely, but that appears to be a minority view for now.  “Taiwan must be very cautious when we make this decision,” said Lo Ping-cheng, the minister in charge of the government’s internal discussions on regulating TikTok. “There is no timetable set for a decision so far.” TikTok has already proven itself an influential platform in major elections. In Malaysia last year, conservative religious parties used the app to attract younger voters who helped them score some key upsets. On the other end of the political spectrum, Thailand’s progressive Move Forward party outperformed pre-election polls in May, in part through more effective use of the app.  Read More: French Lawmakers Give TikTok Six Months to Fix Security ConcernsBloomberg Terminal In the US and Europe, TikTok faces an existential crisis over worries that its feed can be manipulated for political purposes and that user data can be accessed by its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on behalf of the Chinese government.  The company has repeatedly denied it receives data requests from Beijing. In its statement to Bloomberg, it added that “Taiwanese user data is stored in the U.S., Singapore and Malaysia.”  With campaigning in Taiwan underway, one viral video, which garnered almost 900,000 views, highlights the challenge authorities face. The clip accused Vice President Lai Ching-te — the ruling party’s presidential candidate — of risking citizens’ lives in a potential war with China, while alleging his children would be protected because they live in the US and are American citizens. The party has repeatedly said the clip is false.  “Taiwanese people, it’s time to wake up,” the narrator says on the video, hosted on an account run by a 32-year-old Taiwanese engineer who posts under the pseudonym “Citizen V.” That’s a nod to the film V for Vendetta and its message of protesting political tyranny.  The clip was flagged in May by contributors at Cofacts for containing misinformation. After that designation, it was taken down, but by then it had circulated for more than a month. Officials are concerned a rising tide of misleading information will confound the ability of organizations and the government to stop them all.  Cofacts and MyGoPen are part of a constellation of non-profits focused on disinformation who say they are funded by individual donations and foundations, separate from any political party or group.  In an interview, “Citizen V” — who asked not to be identified by his real name — said he was frustrated that his video was singled out. He said he doesn’t see himself as peddling in disinformation but he does want to be an influencer in the election. And he found TikTok to be the best venue for getting his posts — many in support of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People’s Party — to a wider audience. Now the blogger has more than 48,000 followers and about 18 million views in the past two months on TikTok.   Citizen V’s case highlights the difficulty in separating heated rhetoric and misleading claims — part of elections everywhere — from state-sponsored disinformation.  Officials in Taipei have been warning since March about “large-scale” operations from China that seek to interfere with the election, an issue the government has long experience with. Taiwanese agencies faced a record number of cyberattacks after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited in August. Between Pelosi’s trip and local elections last November, the Taipei-based organization Doublethink Lab recorded nearly 3,000 instances of targeted disinformation.  “The most common tactic by China is to create greater confrontation between the major parties,” said Puma Shen, chairperson of Doublethink Lab, which tracks online disinformation. “Their main purpose is to undermine trust in Taiwan.” And while false information is prevalent across Taiwanese social media, usage of TikTok significantly impacts whether people in Taiwan view China positively or negatively, said Shen.  In a report on its website, TikTok said that last year it discovered an influence network of inauthentic accounts operating from Taiwan that primarily targeted Taiwanese audiences to “create a high number of derogatory comments in addition to sharing content in Traditional Chinese targeting civic discourse in Taiwan.” The network had amassed more than 60,000 followers before it was discovered internally and removed, the report said. Another combative and popular political TikTok account is “Taiwan Strait Number One Brother,” which posts videos promoting China’s People’s Liberation Army and criticizing the US. The majority of its nearly 700 posts are dubbed or subtitled in simplified Chinese, rather than the traditional form commonly used in Taiwan — a sign security experts say signals the content may be generated in China.  A person involved in managing the account declined to comment beyond saying that they were based outside of Taiwan.  Cybersecurity experts say it’s not easy to identify whether TikTok accounts are run by real-life political supporters or backed by a state, but the threat of election-related disinformation campaigns will only grow. “We’re seeing more conspiracy-type information that is a lot harder to fight back on,” said Robin Lee, project manager at MyGoPen. “A potential invasion sounds very scary, but is also something that could happen in the future — that you cannot actually fact-check.” ']\n",

      "['Aave, a peer-to-peer crypto lender, is jumping into the increasingly crowded stablecoin industry. Aave’s lending platform cuts out traditional intermediaries like banks and operates on blockchains including Ethereum, where it sets interest rates based on supply and demand. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged at a value of $1, are popular on such platforms. Aave’s new stablecoin, GHO, will be backed by assets supported on Aave, and coded to always be worth exactly $1 on Aave’s network, according to the lender. The offering is the latest in a flurry of efforts to create less volatile cryptocurrencies without having to rely on a centralized issuer. Borrowers often pledge their crypto on Aave to borrow stablecoins, which can be a more convenient means of payment because they are designed to be less volatile than crypto tokens such as Bitcoin.  Read: If Stablecoins Are Stable, Why Are Regulators Tense?: QuickTake But crypto-lending and stablecoins are struggling to overcome a series of scandals, most notably the collapse of TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin. That failure contributed to the later bankruptcies of lending platforms like Genesis Global Holdco and cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  DeFi projects like Aave have struggled to find growth in the aftermath. According to data from DeFiLlama, the total value of cryptocurrencies sent to the DeFi sector has remained relatively unchanged for almost a year at about $46 billion.  Still, the best-known reserve-backed stablecoins, USDT and USDC, issued by Tether and Circle Internet Financial Ltd., respectively, remain popular. Both are managed by centralized organizations that maintain pools of assets designed to be sufficient to protect each coins $1 value.  Read: Biggest Stablecoin Once Backed by Chinese Securities There’ve been several efforts to develop decentralized stablecoins. Dai, a stablecoin managed by MakerDAO, a DeFi lending platform that competes with Aave, is now the third largest stablecoin by market value according to token tracking site Coingecko.  Like Dai, GHO will not be issued by a centralized entity, but be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization known as AaveDAO. DAOs are organizations governed by holders of a special token. “A native stablecoin actually helps to diversify the stablecoins, including in Aave protocol itself,” Stani Kulechov, founder and chief executive officer of Aave and of GHO developer Aave Companies, said in an interview. The income generated by GHO, coming from interest charged to borrowers of the currency on the Aave protocol, will enable AaveDAO to allocate more funds to community contributors, including risk managers, developers, and security experts, according to Kulechov. Kulechov, whose company also develops Lens Protocol, a blockchain-based social media project, hopes that GHO can speed up the mainstream adoption of the DeFi industry. Read: Threads, Not Web3, Is Twitter’s Replacement: Bloomberg Crypto “More than two years ago, the Aave community recognized the need for an Aave-native decentralized and overcollateralized stablecoin that would empower users and serve as a payment layer,” reads an Aave blog post previewed by Bloomberg News.  “Stablecoins have the potential to become the payment layer for web3 because of their speed without the price volatility that has deterred consumers and merchants from using digital currencies.”']\n",

      "['Almost four years after Elon Musk first unveiled Tesla Inc.’s debut pickup, the automaker has built its first Cybertruck. Tesla shared the development on Twitter, posting a photo of workers in safety vests and helmets obscuring much of the vehicle. When Musk first showed a prototype of the wedge-shaped truck in November 2019, the plan was for production to start two years later. Musk has tempered expectations for how quickly Tesla will ramp up production, telling shareholders at the company’s annual meetingBloomberg Terminal in May that the Cybertruck’s radical design poses challenges. He’s said the body will be stainless steel, which can be expensive and difficult to shape and weld. “It’s going to be hard to make the cost affordable because it is a new car, new manufacturing method,” Musk said. “In the grand scheme of things, relative to the production rate of all the other cars we make, it will be small. But it’s still very cool.” Tesla initially said it would sell the Cybertruck in three configurations: But in October 2021, the company removed pricing and specifications from its Cybertruck order page, without explanation. When asked in April of this year for updated specs and pricing, Musk demurredBloomberg Terminal, saying Tesla would save that information for a Cybertruck handover event he hoped to stage around the end of the third quarter. Since Tesla unveiled the vehicle at an event marred by the botched demonstration of supposedly bulletproof glass, Ford Motor Co. introduced an electric version of its best-selling F-150, General Motors Co. began selling its GMC Hummer EV pickup, and Rivian Automotive Inc. launched its R1T truck. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner expects Tesla to deliver 2,000 Cybertrucks this year, a fraction of the 1.78 million vehicles he’s projecting in total. In a June 26 report, he questioned whether the product will boost the company’s profitability, citing the difficulty of optimizing production and need for larger battery packs to enable towing. “This could layer on an additional headwind to margin in the back half” of the year, wrote Rosner, who rates Tesla stock a buy with a $260 price target. The shares closed Friday at $281.38 and have soared 128% this year. Tesla releases second-quarter earnings results on July 19.']\n",

      "['America’s largest semiconductor companies are embarking on a last-ditch effort to head off new curbs on their sales to China, with senior executives traveling to Washington next week for talks with administration officials and lawmakers. The chief executive officers of Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are planning to lobby against extending restrictions on the sale to China of certain chips and the equipment to manufacture the semiconductors that the Biden administration is set to roll out in the coming weeks, people familiar with the matter said. While they don’t expect to stave off all the actions, the companies are sensing a window of opportunity to convince the Biden team that an escalation would hurt the current diplomatic efforts by the White House to engage Chinese officials and establish a more productive relationship, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the trip isn’t yet public.  Chip companies are at the center of what has been an escalating row between Beijing and Washington. The US, where the majority of the technology originates, believes that restricting China’s access to it will bolster national security and hold back the Asian nation’s efforts to advance its military capabilities.  Read More: ASML Faces Tighter Controls on Servicing Chip Gear in China  The companies have argued that being cut off from their largest market will harm their ability to spend on advancing their technology and ultimately undermine US leadership.  Representatives for the three companies declined to comment.  Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gets more than 60% of his company’s revenue from the China region by supplying components to smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp. Intel’s Pat Gelsinger, who visited Beijing earlier this month to show off his company’s latest artificial intelligence chips, counts the nation as his biggest sales region. The country provides about a quarter of Intel’s sales. And for Nvidia, run by co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, China provides about a fifth of revenue.  The Commerce Department in October issued rules that bar semiconductor equipment makers from selling certain tools to China, as well as prohibit the export of some chips used in artificial intelligence applications — an announcement that roiled the industry last October. So far, chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc. have taken the biggest hits to revenue, being forced to knock billions of dollars off their projections. But the restrictions, which companies fear will be extended to other classes of chips, are also affecting some makers of devices. Nvidia’s ability to ship its industry-leading artificial intelligence accelerators to China has been curbed by an approval process, costing it sales. “I’m alarmed that some American CEOs continue to advocate for weaker export controls on sensitive technology,” Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of a House committee on competition with China, said in a statement on Friday. “The Biden administration needs to tighten our export controls on advanced chips” The administration is planning to update and finalize the measures by strengthening what’s already been announced. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the US is using some of its powers to influence overseas companies to further cut off China’s access. ASML Holding NV, one of the biggest providers of chipmaking equipment, is facing tighter restrictions from its home government in the Netherlands and new restrictions from the US, because some of its components are made in America.  In general, the US new rules will also reflect the outcome of negotiations with Japan and the Netherlands, people briefed on the plans said. Reuters previously reported on the plan for some of the CEOs to meet with US officials.']\n",

Friday, clearing a path for the companies to close the largest gaming deal ever in the US. The 9th Circuit US Court of Appeals ruling means that only UK regulators stand between the companies closing the deal before a July 18 deadline. Britain’s antitrust appeals court has scheduled a hearing July 17 to discuss the companies’ request to pause the challenge to their deal by the country’s competition agency. “This brings us another step closer to the finish line in this marathon of global regulatory reviews,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. Activision didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Activision climbed as much as 4.4% in after-hours trading, rising to $94 from its close of $90.07. Microsoft gained 1.5%. The ruling is a blow to the FTC and its Chair Lina Khan, who sought to block the merger over concerns that Microsoft would withhold Activision’s most popular games from rival consoles or services. The court-ordered pause on Microsoft’s Activision merger was set to expire at midnight Pacific time on Friday.

      "['      The most interesting rivalry in social media right now goes deeper than cage matches. It’s that the very existence of Threads and its immediate success — 100 million users in four days — is thanks in no small part to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who set off a chain of events that led to the deterioration of his creation and a big opportunity for Mark Zuckerberg. It goes all the way back to 2005, when Zuckerberg asked a Stanford University student named Kevin Systrom if he would come work at Zuckerberg’s company, Facebook. Systrom said no — he wanted to stay in school — and ended up interning with the team that would create Twitter, befriending Dorsey. When Twitter started catching on, Zuckerberg noticed. He tried to buy it in 2008 for $500 million. Twitter said no. Systrom eventually co-founded his own app, Instagram. Dorsey championed the app and promoted it on Twitter to all of his friends and followers. Dorsey believed in Instagram so deeply that he agreed to be one of its first investors at Systrom’s invitation. Dorsey tried to get Twitter to buy it. Systrom wasn’t interested. But in 2012, right after Systrom rejected Twitter’s third overture, Zuckerberg offered $1 billion, an unimaginable sum for a mobile app at the time. Systrom said yes. When he heard the news, Dorsey was crushed. He stopped posting there and ended his friendship with Systrom. In the years that followed, Instagram got even more popular, including with celebrities — one of Twitter’s sweet spots. Zuckerberg built Twitter-like features into Facebook and continued to grow well beyond Twitter’s size. Dorsey returned to Twitter as chief executive officer in 2015 and remained sad about the state of social media and Facebook’s consolidation of power. He laid the groundwork there for a new kind of social networking framework via a project called Bluesky, built on an open system any developer could plug into. Life running a public Twitter, appeasing shareholders and activist investors, began to wear on Dorsey. He started chatting with his friend Elon Musk about whether anything could be done. Musk, of course, took on the challenge. Dorsey initially said Musk was the “singular solution” he trusted to take Twitter private. But again, Dorsey would be disappointed: Musk slashed Twitter’s staff, stopped paying its bills, introduced confusing content rules and spurned longtime users. Twitter, facing technical issues under Musk, was at its most vulnerable — and that’s when Zuckerberg struck. Threads launched via Instagram, promising to build on an open protocol. Zuckerberg had three great reasons to swoop in on Twitter: Musk’s stumbles, Instagram’s super-powerful network and the new popularity of open-source versions of Twitter — and remarkably, Dorsey had a hand in all three. Trained on vast amounts of information, large language models identify language patterns, and then use them to convincingly mimic the way people communicate. Check out our simplified depiction of the process. A Stability AI founder sued the company, claiming he was tricked into selling his stake for $100, just months before the British AI startup hit a $1 billion valuation. US shoppers spent $12.7 billion online during Amazon.com’s 48-hour Prime Day, up 6.1% from a year ago but short of estimates for 9.5% growth, according to Adobe. China loosened some of the guardrails it proposed for ChatGPT-style services months ago, as it acknowledges the need to compete for global leadership in AI.

      "['      Over the weekend, tech Twitter couldn’t stop talking about a bed-wetting. It started after an industry executive posted about his techified mattress made by a company called Eight Sleep Inc., which has raised about $165 million from venture capitalists. The startup offers “intelligent sleep tech” – including slumber tracking, automatic temperature adjustments with heating and cooling for each side of the bed, and a built-in alarm to “wake you up with a gradual temperature change and a subtle, chest-level vibration on your side.” The problem? Much like a water bed, apparently sometimes it leaks. On Saturday, @ericdwolan posted a photo of a soaked mattress, writing, “The annual ‘my @eightsleep sprung a leak and I need a replacement.’” He added: “I love this product but wish it didn’t break so often.” Others chimed in to say that leakage was a common occurrence for them, too. One Twitter user said the flood of liquid cost him a security deposit for an apartment.  These issues have not deterred some of tech’s highest-profile figures from using the products. This year, Elon Musk responded to a promotional Eight Sleep tweet with the praise: “It’s good.” Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg recently posted on his new Threads app that he gets seven to eight hours of shut-eye each night, in part thanks to Eight Sleep. And venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said on Sunday that he uses the device.  The startup’s investors include big names like baseball player Alex Rodriguez, AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt. Perhaps the most notable Eight Sleep user, though, is Bryan Johnson, the software entrepreneur who spends $2 million a year  trying to avoid aging.  What about the leakage? “We take all customer issues extremely seriously,” the company said in a statement. “And when we become aware of a leak we promptly take care of our members and ship a warranty replacement as quickly as within 24 hours.” Eight Sleep added that only a “small fraction” of its customers have reported that the products leave their beds wet. Its latest version “has more durable materials, a special waterproof layer, and is rigorously tested to simulate 10 years of use and as a result leaks are rare.” Even with a speedy replacement, the case of a “smart” mattress or mattress cover that sometimes wets itself is a particularly funny example of what happens when Silicon Valley sets out to reinvent a product that may not have needed it (in this case, a bed). The incident calls to mind Juicero, an internet-connected $400 juicer that purported to draw more nutrients out of single-serve packets of fruits and vegetables. It turned out, per a  Bloomberg report, that the packets could be squeezed just as effectively by hand.  Eight Sleep may offer more temperature control than a normal mattress, but there are some downsides to bringing too much technology into the bedroom. Plus, the company’s latest model is priced at over $3,000. As evidenced by its famous devotees, it’s clear that Silicon Valley will continue its inexorable march toward the optimally quantified life; but a cheaper way to control the temperature might be a fan.  AI is making politics easier, cheaper and more dangerous. Voters are seeing AI-generated campaign materials — and likely don’t know it. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was among the US officials whose emails were breached in a  hack of government accounts that Microsoft said originated from China. Microsoft is set for a second shot at winning UK approval of its $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, but regulators warned that any antitrust fixes would trigger a new probe, potentially further delaying the biggest gaming deal in history. The latest sign of investors’ unrelenting demand for all things AI-related: a record rally in drug discovery firm Recursion Pharmaceuticals following an investment from Nvidia. Wipro, the Indian outsourcing provider, plans to spend $1 billion to train its 250,000 employees in AI and integrate the technology into its product offerings. US consumers spent $6.4 billion online in the first 24 hours of Amazon’s Prime Day, according to Adobe. That’s up 6% from a year ago but fell short of estimates for even stronger growth.

      "['      A US judge’s refusal to halt Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. is a blow to Sony Group Corp. It’s also a huge validation of Sony’s power and the central role its PlayStation console plays in the fate of Microsoft’s games business and the whole industry. Microsoft has argued the deal math doesn’t add up if you remove sales of Call of Duty on PlayStation, and the judge noted that the plan the Microsoft board signed off on relied on these sales. Additionally, the judge was persuaded by Microsoft’s argument that Call of Duty is like Minecraft where play across competing console platforms is key to retaining players. US regulators argued Microsoft’s  move to make some ZeniMax games exclusive to its console and Windows PCs after acquiring the game maker were proof of the company’s incentive to restrict access to Call of Duty. The simple fact is that, as consoles go, the PlayStation is simply too big to ignore for a huge, multiplayer game franchise. Acquiring Activision and halting PlayStation sales would burn a decent chunk of Microsoft’s $69 billion on Day One. If Call of Duty were to go the Halo route, another game — maybe from Electronic Arts Inc.’s Battlefield franchise — would take its place. So the PlayStation gets to keep Call of Duty. That’s good for Sony, right? Not necessarily. Sony has been lobbying heavily against the deal in multiple jurisdictions. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, in her ruling, gave a pretty strong analysis for why: “Before the merger, a consumer wanting to play a Call of Duty console game had to buy a PlayStation or an Xbox. After the merger, consumers can utilize the cloud to play on the device of choice, including, it is intended, on the Nintendo Switch. Perhaps bad for Sony. But good for Call of Duty gamers and future gamers.” This is not just potentially a loss for Sony. It’s a big loss for the Federal Trade Commission and its chair, Lina Khan. In the immediate aftermath of the judge’s decision, FTC officials were leaning toward filing an appeal, Bloomberg reported. Judge Corley had criticized the FTC for leaning so much on the perspective of Sony executive Jim Ryan for the agency’s argument. “The FTC’s heavy reliance on Mr. Ryan’s testimony is unpersuasive,” the judge wrote. “Sony opposes the merger; its opposition is understandable.” The ruling offered a pat on the head to the deal’s opponents. “Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox,” Corley wrote. It will surely come as cold comfort to Ryan and Khan. Dozens of companies worldwide, including Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and ING Groep, had client data compromised when a criminal hacking group exploited a security flaw in a file transfer tool. Separately, two UK teenagers were accused of masterminding hacks on Nvidia, Grand Theft Auto and Uber. Senior US national security officials are scheduled to defend their use and development of AI on Tuesday in a classified briefing with senators. Broadcom’s $61 billion VMware deal is set to receive approval in the EU. Salesforce will raise prices for the first time in seven years, with an increase of about 9% next month.

      "[' Like other Taylor Swift fans, I’ve become intimately familiar with virtual queues. But first…  Three things you need to know today:    • Threads hit 100 million users just days after launch• EU sealed a new transatlantic data-transfer pact with the US• A cyberattack forced Ukraine to postpone its June inflation release After three years of the pandemic and a drip, drip of bad news, I suspect many of us are willing to go the extra mile to see our favorite musicians in person. Taylor Swift’s Eras tour is testament to that: She’s expected to make music history (again) by shattering the $1 billion threshold for ticket sales and delivering the highest-grossing tour ever. The bad news? Those seeking the coveted tickets are captives of one of the internet’s most unpleasant rituals. The online ticketing process is an international mess. If you thought the competition for tickets was fierce in the US, try to see a show in Asia. The continent has hundreds of millions of Swift fans and only a handful of stops on the Eras tour. Hong Kong, despite its claims in years past to being “Asia’s world city,” wasn’t among them. That means everyone needs to compete for the shows in Tokyo next February or in Singapore next March or venture farther afield to Australia, France or the UK to get their Swift fix. Few artists have the same gravitational pull. A single Instagram post from Swift reportedly caused US voter registration to spike. Her fans overwhelmed Ticketmaster’s systems in an incident last year that helped push its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment Inc., to face the music in front of the US Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel. Just like in the US, most fans in Singapore had to turn to Ticketmaster as the only viable online platform. The other options were to sign up for United Overseas Bank Ltd.’s credit or debit cards to get an exclusive ticket pre-sale or wait for hours at branches of Singapore Post, according to local media. But that still left thousands disappointed, including a friend and fellow Swift fan in Beijing, who gave up after sitting in a queue behind tens of thousands of others. I had to join a lottery for one of Swift’s four shows in Tokyo, which could only be done on a platform run by the convenience store operator Lawson Inc. Winners will need to secure the tickets on a smartphone app from Avex Entertainment Inc. With few alternative platforms, fans from this part of the world are well-acquainted with scalpers. The resale business is especially strong in China. Earlier this year, tickets to a Beijing show to see the Taiwanese band Mayday sold out online in five seconds, according to Chinese state media outlets. If all other plans fail, a friend in the UK offered to join the lottery there on my behalf. Look what you made me do, Ticketmaster. Among the lawyers, litigants and spectators who packed into a San Francisco courtroom last month for a hearing on the fate of the biggest video gaming deal ever was another breed altogether: the merger arbitrager. Social media platforms didn’t adequately moderate harmful content during recent riots in France, European Commissioner Thierry Breton said.

      "['The Israel Defense Forces have started using artificial intelligence to select targets for air strikes and organize wartime logistics as tensions escalate in the occupied territories and with arch-rival Iran. Though the military won’t comment on specific operations, officials say that it now uses an AI recommendation system that can crunch huge amounts of data to select targets for air strikes. Ensuing raids can then be rapidly assembled with another artificial intelligence model called Fire Factory, which uses data about military-approved targets to calculate munition loads, prioritize and assign thousands of targets to aircraft and drones, and propose a schedule.  While both systems are overseen by human operators who vet and approve individual targets and air raid plans, according to an IDF official, the technology is still not subject to any international or state-level regulation. Proponents argue that the advanced algorithms may surpass human capabilities and could help the military minimize casualties, while critics warn of the potentially deadly consequences of relying on increasingly autonomous systems. “If there is a mistake in the calculation of the AI, and if the AI is not explainable, then who do we blame for the mistake?” said Tal Mimran, a lecturer of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and former legal counsel for the army. “You can wipe out an entire family based on a mistake.” Details of the army’s operational use of AI remain largely classified, yet statements from military officials suggest that the IDF has gained battlefield experience with the controversial systems through periodic flareups in the Gaza Strip, where Israel frequently carries out air strikes in response to rocket attacks. In 2021, the IDF described the 11-day conflict in Gaza as the world’s first “AI war,” citing its use of artificial intelligence to identify rocket launchpads and deploy drone swarms. Israel also conducts raids in Syria and Lebanon, targeting what it says are weapons shipments to Iran-backed militias like Hezbollah. In recent months, Israel has been issuing near-daily   warnings to Iran over its uranium enrichment, vowing it will not allow the country to obtain nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Should the two enter into a military confrontation, the IDF anticipates that Iranian proxies in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon would retaliate, setting the stage for the first serious multi-front conflict for Israel since a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria 50 years ago sparked the Yom Kippur War. AI-based tools like Fire Factory are tailored for such a scenario, according to IDF officials. “What used to take hours now takes minutes, with a few more minutes for human review,” said Col. Uri, who heads the army’s digital transformation unit and who spoke at the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv on the condition that only his first name be used for security reasons. “With the same amount of people, we do much more.”  The system, these officials stressed, is designed for all-out war.  Expanding Intelligence? The IDF has long made use of AI, but in recent years it has expanded those systems across various units as it seeks to position itself as a global leader in autonomous weaponry. Some of these systems were built by Israeli defense contractors; others, like the StarTrack border control cameras, which are trained on thousands of hours of footage to identify people and objects, were developed by the army. Collectively, they comprise a vast digital architecture dedicated to interpreting enormous amounts of drone and CCTV footage, satellite imagery, electronic signals, online communications and other data for military use. Dealing with this torrent of information is the purpose of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center, run by the army’s 8200 unit. Based within the intelligence division,   that unit is where many of the country’s tech multi-millionaires, including Palo Alto Networks Inc.’s  Nir Zuk and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd founder  Gil Shwed, did their mandatory military service before forming successful startups. According to a spokesman, the Center was responsible for developing the system that “transformed the entire concept of targets in the IDF.” The secretive nature of how such tools are developed has raised serious concerns, including that the gap between semi-autonomous systems and entirely automated killing machines could be narrowed overnight. In such a scenario, machines would be empowered to both locate and strike targets, with humans removed entirely from positions of decision-making.  “It’s just a software change that could make them go to not being semi but to being completely autonomous,” said Catherine Connolly, an automated decision researcher at Stop Killer Robots, a  coalition of nongovernmental organizations that includes Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Israel says it has no plans to remove human oversight in coming years. Another worry is that the fast adoption of AI is outpacing research into its inner workings. Many algorithms are developed by private companies and militaries that do not disclose propriety information, and critics have underlined the built-in lack of transparency in how algorithms reach their conclusions. The IDF acknowledged the problem, but said output is carefully reviewed by soldiers and that its military AI systems leave behind technical breadcrumbs, giving human operators the ability to recreate their steps. “Sometimes when you introduce more complex AI components, neural networks and the like, understanding what ‘went through its head,’ figuratively speaking, is pretty complicated. And then sometimes I’m willing to say I’m satisfied with traceability, not explainability. That is, I want to understand what is critical for me to understand about the process and monitor it, even if I don’t understand what every ‘neuron’ is doing,’” said Uri.  The IDF declined to talk about facial recognition technology, which has been strongly criticized by human rights groups, although it did say it has refrained from integrating AI into recruitment software out of concern that it could discriminate against women and potential cadets from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The main advantage of integrating AI into battlefield systems, according to some experts, is the potential to reduce civilian casualties. “I think that there’s an efficiency and effectiveness benefit to using these technologies correctly. And within good functioning technological parameters, there can be very, very high precision,” said Simona R. Soare, a research fellow at the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies. “It can help you with a lot of things that you need to do on the go, in the fog of battle. And that is very difficult to do on the best of days.” “There are also many things that can go wrong, too,” she added.  Ethical Concerns While Israeli leaders have outlined their intention to make the country an “AI superpower,” they’ve been vague on the details. The Defense Ministry declined to comment on how much it’s invested in AI, and the army would not discuss specific defense contracts, though it did confirm that Fire Factory was developed by Israeli defense contractor Rafael. Further obscuring the picture is that, unlike during the nuclear arms race, when leaking details of weapons’ capabilities was a key aspect of deterrence, autonomous and AI-assisted systems are being developed by governments, militaries, and private defense companies in secret. “We can assume that the Americans and even the Chinese and maybe several other countries have advanced systems in those fields as well,” said Liran Antebi, a senior researcher at the Israel-based Institute for National Security Studies. But unlike Israel, “they have, as much as I know, never demonstrated operational use and success.” For now, there aren’t any limitations. Despite a decade of UN-sponsored talks, there is no international framework establishing who bears responsibility for civilian casualties, accidents or unintended escalations when a computer misjudges.  “There’s also a question of testing and the data that these systems are trained on,” said Connolly from the Stop Killer Robots coalition. “How precise and accurate can you know a system is going to be unless it’s already been trained and tested on people?” Such concerns are why Mimran, the law lecturer at Hebrew University, believes that the IDF should exclusively use AI for defensive purposes. During his tenure in the army, Mimran manually vetted targets to make sure that attacks complied with international law. That taught him that, regardless of technology, “there is a point where you need to make a value-based decision.” “And for that,” he said, “we cannot rely on AI.”']\n",

It plans to maintain a high exposure to stocks versus cash for the rest of the year.  The fund’s top holdings as of the end of the first half included electronics supplier Luxshare Precision Industry Co., auto components maker Huizhou Desay Sv Automotive Co., and Will Semiconductor Co. The vehicle also increased its exposure to Iflytek Co. and Suzhou TFC Optical Communication Co. in the three months ended June. Investors are debating if Chinese equities have hit a bottom as signs of further policy support and the end of a crackdown on the tech sector fuel hopes of a recovery. Global fundsBloomberg Terminal bought the most local shares since January on Thursday, in a possible sign that the tide may be turning for the market.

In comparison, the CSI 300 Index has climbed less than 1% since end-December. Managers of the Soochow Mobile fund, which oversees the equivalent of $38 million, are of the view that the onshore stock market will enter a “tech era” in the next three to five years. AI and the policy drive for a digital economy will fuel a new growth engine, they said. The fund remains upbeat on semiconductors for the next six months, on expectations that fundamentals will improve. “ChatGPT applications may bring about smarter hardware, and spur a cycle of replacements in consumer devices,” according to the filing.

Slide it on, and you’ll be confronted with an angry customer, frustrated over a mix-up with their account. Your task: talk them down and make them feel heard. Or you can practice keeping your cool while responding to a robbery, and then unwind by relaxing on a virtual island or by sitting on a unicorn.  Bank of America Corp. uses artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the metaverse as part of an immersive training program for its 2,000 new hires. The move reflects a larger shift in the banking sector, as firms develop technology to enhance performance and cut down costs.  “These simulations act like practice reps. It makes a new employee experienced, even if they’re brand new,” John Jordan, head of the Academy at Bank of America, said in an interview.   Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in April that AI could have “extreme benefits” and would help to reduce headcount. But he also urged caution. “We have to understand how the decisions are made” as AI becomes more advanced, he saidBloomberg Terminal. Read More: JPMorgan’s AI Push Has Wall Street Rivals Playing Catch-Up At the week-long training, Bank of America executives deliver keynotes and host panels on subjects like “diversity and inclusion” and “responsible growth,” the firm’s motto. But on their breaks, new hires are encouraged to visit the conference rooms stocked with dozens of VR headsets. Using the technology, employees see a 360-degree view of a bank branch. There, they can learn by doing, not just listening — they even get virtual credit for doing so. Additional modules walk employees through the bank’s history and explain their benefits packages. Another module offers “wellness” experiences, including that mystical unicorn.  Mike Wynn, innovation and design executive for Bank of America’s Academy, said the virtual trainings offer real-world scenarios, such as a customer asking for large sums of money or complaining about a fraudulent account. Employees can also engage in an AI-based conversation with a bot acting as a Bank of America client, and another bot coaching them through the proper responses.  This immersive experience isn’t just for new hires: Bank of America has been using it for more than 200,000 staffers around the world. Every one of its call centers has an AI coach to help rehearse conversations with customers. A manager having a tough time getting through to an employee can set them up with an AI bot for further training.   Wynn said AI and metaverse trainings offer unique advantages. “It’s hard to teach traditionally. VR creates anxiety, it gets your heart rate up. It makes you nervous.”  When Bank of America first piloted its VR program in 2019, 97% of the participants felt more comfortable performing their tasks after going through the simulations. Bank of America found that employees absorbed training material faster than they did in traditional classroom settings. But technology has its limits, Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who researches the impacts of disruptive technologies on business and society, told Bloomberg News. “Even if a machine could provide insight into emotional questions, I as a trainee might still prefer a human trainer,” he said. Wynn said this new technology is “not about removing the human connection. It’s about making the human connection stronger, simulating reality.” Bank of America is also weighing using the metaverse to tap a younger generation of potential hires at career fairs. “Instead of telling them about the experience in banking, we show them that day what it’s like to live the life of an associate,” Jordan said.']\n",

      "['China has loosened some of the guardrails it proposed for ChatGPT-style services months ago, as it acknowledges the need to compete for global leadership in artificial intelligence. The finalized guidelines, one of the world’s first major moves to regulate the nascent technology, removed some specific restrictions from the initial draft released in April, signaling a more flexible and accommodating approach. The 24 guidelines, set out in a statement Thursday, will go into effect on Aug. 15 and will be overseen by seven state agencies, led by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the nation’s top internet regulator. The National Development and Reform Commission along with the country’s education, science and technology ministries have also been added in the final version. Among the various provisions are requirements for platform providers to carry out a security review and register their services with the government, as was required in the April draft. While the final edition still places much of the regulatory burden on platforms, it injects a focus on development and innovation alongside security safeguards for the strategic AI industry, which lies at the core of Beijing’s tech rivalry with Washington. “The final version of the law significantly watered down many stringent requirements in the earlier draft released by the CAC, sending a strong signal of cautious and tolerant approach in the oversight of generative AI,” said Angela Zhang, director of the Center for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong. Offshore providers of generative AI tools — if they are aimed at Chinese residents — must also comply with the set of rules, but Chinese-developed tools that only serve overseas users are exempted. “This means more opportunities will be in enterprise-facing applications and people will be more cautious about consumer-facing entrepreneurship,” said Frances Du, founding partner of J Ventures. “However, now that there are seven agencies involved, that will make it harder to gauge the specific execution style.” The official guidelines remove provisions from the draft that included fines as high as 100,000 yuan ($14,000) for violations, as well as the requirement for platform operators to act within a three-month grace period to rectify problematic content. The articles encourage “the use of secure and trustworthy chips, software, tools, algorithms, and data sources,” and urge China’s developers of AI chips, models and software to help set international standards and pursue technological exchange.

The fear is that overly onerous regulations could limit the industry’s development, at a time when China is seeking to catch up to and surpass the US in the technology. You Chuanman, director of the IIA Center for Regulation and Global Governance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Shenzhen campus, said the final version of the regulations appeared to allow greater flexibility by removing specifics in the grace period and by adding a greater focus on promoting development. “A clear-cut deadline of three months could be a daunting challenge,” You said. “In the overall content, there are quite a few additions of clauses to promote development, and there is more emphasis placed on the use of existing legal tools.” Changes in the final guidelines:']\n",

      "['Apple’s new Vision Products Group reflects a shift away from its famed product-development process. Also: The company prepares for its fall devices, new software betas roll out, and Apple is accused of negotiating in bad faith by its first unionized retail store. Last week in Power On: The Vision Pro will take far longer than the iPad and Apple Watch to become a major revenue contributor.   When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the late 1990s, he threw away the company’s product-development playbook and shifted to a “functional” management structure. That’s why the company has no iPhone or iPad division, no AirPods group and no dedicated Mac organization. Instead, Apple is organized by departments like software engineering, hardware development, machine learning, design and services. Contributions from all those groups are then funneled into new features and products.  But Apple’s most recent new product categories, including the Vision Pro headset, show that its strategy is evolving. The Vision Pro has its own dedicated division inside of the company. The unit, run by Mike Rockwell, was dubbed the Technology Development Group, or TDG, from its inception around 2015 until the name changed in recent weeks. It’s now internally known as the Vision Products Group, or VPG. The group doesn’t depend on Apple’s main software and hardware engineering and other departments. It has its own versions of those teams, reporting to Rockwell, in addition to ones for strategy, computer vision, content, app development and project management. If the Vision products were developed in standard Apple fashion, the software engineering for the headset would have been led by Craig Federighi and his software engineering organization. The hardware would have been developed alongside Apple’s other devices under John Ternus, and the content arm would be tucked within Eddy Cue’s services empire.  That doesn’t mean the Vision Pro Group isn’t collaborating with other parts of Apple. It works with the design and operations teams overseen by Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, and the Johny Srouji-led chip unit that makes M2 and R1 processors. It also relies on frameworks and other building blocks created for iOS and macOS by Federighi’s group, which is responsible for some of the headset’s developer tools as well. And it gets a helping hand from the main hardware organization. When the Vision Pro was finally announced, people working on it believed the development team would eventually be broken up and distributed across the company — matching the approach used by Apple’s other core devices. But the recent name change seems to imply that the current structure is here to stay. I have a few possible explanations for this choice: It’s also worth noting that the unit’s new name and use of a plural in “products” seems to confirm the Vision Pro is the first of many headsets to come from Apple. As I’ve reported previously, the group is already working on a lower-cost version of the device along with a second-generation Pro model. While the Vision Pro Group puts a spotlight on this organizational evolution, this isn’t the first time that Apple has veered from its usual approach. A similar story played out for Apple’s previous new product category and is currently the case for its next major initiative.  During most of its development, the Apple Watch’s hardware and software engineering teams were placed under Williams, the COO, instead of below Apple’s senior vice presidents of hardware and software. That remains partially true today: Smartwatch software still reports to Williams, but hardware engineering has been moved under Ternus.  The company’s self-driving car team, which operates as the Special Projects Group, or SPG, is also an outlier. The unit has its own staff for software engineering, computer vision, machine learning, hardware engineering, industrial design, cloud services, project management and quality assurance. And given the complexity of building a car, that may never change.  Apple just launched new Macs, but more could be coming this fall. The company is gearing up for its busy season: It’s set to announce the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro lines in September alongside new Apple Watches. And there should be another launch in October, I’m told. The likely topic based on past history? Macs. Now that Apple has gotten the 15-inch MacBook Air and new M2 Ultra-based Macs out the door, the October launch could feature the first Macs with M3 chips. October is too early for new high-end MacBook Pros or desktops, so the first beneficiaries of the new chip should be the next iMac, 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. For those wondering about the iPad — another product that typically gets refreshed in October —  I wouldn’t expect any major upgrades until the M3 iPad Pros with OLED screens arrive next year. But an iPad Air model that boosts its specifications is also in development. Apple releases first iOS 17 public beta version and updated developer beta after security flaw discovery. With about eight weeks to go until the iPhone 15’s announcement, Apple has reached a key development stage for its latest software updates. The iOS 17 public beta is identical to the third iOS 17 developer beta from the week prior, so the public beta is mostly an indicator that Apple believes the software is now stable enough for non-developers to use. Public betas for macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10 and tvOS 17 were also released.  In other iOS news, the third developer betas were rereleased and a rapid security update for iOS 16 was issued to patch a WebKit flaw that Apple says was possibly exploited. To further complicate matters, the rapid security patch was pulled, then rereleased, after it was found to break several popular third-party apps. Even so, it’s a good reminder to update your Apple devices with security fixes as soon as possible. Apple’s first unionized store in the US says the iPhone maker is negotiating unfairly. If you’ve been following the play-by-play of the unionization efforts at Apple over the past couple of years, this shouldn’t be too surprising. The union representing Apple’s outlet in Towson, Maryland, claims that the company is negotiating in bad faith by countering demands with existing policies, showing up late to meetings, not responding to key proposals (despite the sides tentatively agreeing on about a dozen topics) and sharing updates about the talks with employees at other retail stores. The union filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board, while Apple maintains that it hasn’t done anything wrong.  Samsung Unpacked: July 26. Following its usual approach, Samsung is set to launch its latest devices in the weeks prior to Apple’s big iPhone unveiling in September. The Samsung event, called Unpacked, is likely to include the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, alongside a fresh tablet, multiple smartwatches and potentially a new version of its Galaxy Buds. The presentation gets underway at 7 a.m. New York time.Apple Quarterly Earnings: Aug. 3. The company is set to release results for the fiscal third quarter, the last three-month period before the iPhone 15 is introduced. The quarter wasn’t packed with big revenue drivers, but it did see the release of new Macs: the 15-inch MacBook Air and M2 Ultra Mac Pro, as well as the M2 Ultra and M2 Max Mac Studios. Wall Street is projecting revenue of about $81 billion, which would mark the third straight year-over-year decline. Growth is expected to resume in the coming quarters.

      "['A US appeals court denied a Federal Trade Commission bid to pause Microsoft Corp.’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. Friday, clearing a path for the companies to close the largest gaming deal ever in the US. The 9th Circuit US Court of Appeals ruling means that only UK regulators stand between the companies closing the deal before a July 18 deadline. Britain’s antitrust appeals court has scheduled a hearing July 17 to discuss the companies’ request to pause the challenge to their deal by the country’s competition agency. “This brings us another step closer to the finish line in this marathon of global regulatory reviews,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. Activision didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Activision climbed as much as 4.4% in after-hours trading, rising to $94 from its close of $90.07. Microsoft gained 1.5%. The ruling is a blow to the FTC and its Chair Lina Khan, who sought to block the merger over concerns that Microsoft would withhold Activision’s most popular games from rival consoles or services. The court-ordered pause on Microsoft’s Activision merger was set to expire at midnight Pacific time on Friday. Microsoft has strong incentive to close the deal before the July 18 deadline to avoid paying a $3 billion breakup fee to Activision. The FTC declined to comment on the ruling and whether it plans to pursue its internal case opposing the deal. Proceedings before an FTC administrative judge were scheduled to start Aug. 2. The UK Competition and Markets Authority, which vetoed the merger in April amid concerns over the deal’s impact on the cloud gaming market, has agreed to give Microsoft an unprecedented second chance to offer a remedy. Microsoft has offered to sell off the cloud-based market rights for games in the UK, Bloomberg earlier reported.

      "['The US Federal Trade Commission urged an appeals court to delay Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc. while the agency’s challenge to the largest-ever gaming deal is pending. The FTC wants the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn a lower-court judge’s July 10 order that cleared the companies to proceed toward their July 18 closure deadline. “Consummation of the proposed deal would irreversibly alter the status quo and, if done before the merits of the FTC’s appeal are heard, would irreparably harm the FTC’s ability to order effective relief for the public should the deal prove to be in violation of the antitrust laws,” FTC lawyers wrote in the filing Thursday. US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley earlier Thursday rejected the FTC’s request that she extend a pause on the deal while the appeal proceeds. Barring action by the appeals court, Microsoft and Activision can complete the deal as of 11:59 p.m. in San Francisco on July 14.  The FTC isn’t backing down in the antitrust fight that represents a major test of its ability to block big tech deals in court after the agency lost a challenge to an acquisition by Meta Platforms Inc. earlier this year.  FTC Chair Lina Khan defended the agency’s decision to appeal the ruling earlier Thursday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Republicans criticized the FTC’s record of merger losses, asking if she was “losing on purpose” to influence Congress to pass antitrust legislation. “We fight hard when we believe there is a law violation,” she said. “When we get an adverse ruling, our teams look closely at the text of opinion and see if there are errors on matters of law that warrant an appeal.”    Read More: FTC’s Khan Branded ‘Bully’ in GOP Attack Over Deals, Ethics  The appeal creates another legal hurdle for Microsoft is it pushes to close a deal that would help expand its presence in mobile gaming and vault itself to the No. 3 position in the global gaming market after Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sony Corp. The FTC is angling to move ahead with an administrative antitrust challenge to the deal that was scheduled to begin early next month. Microsoft also remains stuck in limbo with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority after that agency vetoed the deal in May.  Read More: Microsoft Cleared to Buy Activision in US as UK Pauses Fight  After Corley’s decision came down, the CMA said it’s willing to reassess proposals from Microsoft and agreed to pause the companies’ appeal before the Competition Appeal Tribunal. That hold gives the firms a chance to suggest potential fixes aimed at easing UK concerns that the takeover would stymie competition. But a restructuring of the deal could also trigger a new investigation by Britain’s antitrust watchdog.']\n",

      "['Google’s decision to allow developers to expand the ways nonfungible tokens can be used in their games on the Play Store was met with a collective sigh of relief on crypto Twitter.  NFT investors, who have for months watched the prices of their collections fall and interest in this colorful corner of the digital-asset market wane, see the changes in Google’s policy as a sign that the market is not dead yet. “We’re so back,” said Kyle McCollom, a co-founder at a Brooklyn-based crypto startup.  “You thought NFTs were dead?” tweeted Daniel Borovik, creator of multiple collections listed on OpenSea, the largest marketplace by volume for nonfungible tokens.  In a blog post published Wednesday, Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it will allow developers to offer games where players can buy, sell and earn tokenized digital assets—like nonfungible tokens—subject to specific guidelines.  NFTs once ranked among the crypto industry’s hottest assets, attracting the attention of celebrities like Madonna, Justin Bieber and superstar DJ Steve Aoki.  Read: Security, Art or Mere Picture: Celebrities Draw Scrutiny to NFTs But in the months since the collapse of FTX, the digital assets most closely associated with cartoonish pictures of apes have since seen their value and popularity plummet. Monthly global sales volumes for NFTs fell 38% to $653 million in June compared with the same period last year, according to blockchain data provider CryptoSlam.  Google has had a mixed strategy on blockchain and crypto: Google Play still bans crypto mining apps from its marketplace, while Google Cloud in 2021 teamed up with Dapper Labs, the creator of the NBA Top Shot digital collectibles. The move to clarify its policies also further aligns Google with main rival Apple Inc., which introduced new App Store guidelines in October on crypto trading, as well as on the use of NFTs within apps and games. Both Google and Apple have been lambasted by the crypto and gaming industries for high fees on in-app transactions. Brian Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer of crypto exchange Coinbase, publicly criticized Apple last year over these in-app transaction rules, citing their “app store monopoly.” Google Play’s updated guidelines, which go into effect Dec. 7, say that games can support transactions involving tokenized assets under the platform’s existing Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy. Developers will have to follow specific rules, such as ensuring that the value of an NFT is made clear to a player at the time of purchase.

      "['Turkey’s Papara became the country’s first fintech firm to reach unicorn status following a recent deal with Spain’s Beka Finance SV SA. Beka last week received an undisclosed amount of cash and shares in the Istanbul-based firm in exchange for the acquisition of Papara’s Spanish rival Rebellion, which offers mobile banking services such as money transfers, prepaid cards and cash-back. “When we gave Beka Finance our shares, they became our shareholders at a price level that valued our company at unicorn level,” Papara founder Ahmed Karsli said in a phone interview, referring to a tech startup with a valuation over $1 billion. Papara’s unicorn status is particularly significant after a global slump in valuations in global tech assets reached Turkey. Venture capitalists only invested about $111 million in Turkish assets during the first half of this year, according to data from startups.watch, an Istanbul-based industry monitoring group. This compares to the boom years of 2021 and 2022 when investments in Turkish startups reached $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.  Founded in 2016 as an electronic payments firm, Papara was growing only on its equity until Beka Finance joined as a partner, according to Birce Ciravoglu, Papara’s M&A and expansion director. This year, it expanded its product offerings beyond core banking services to include pet, home, travel and mobile insurance.  “Papara is the first fintech unicorn startup out of Turkey,” she said in a phone interview. “It has also become one of the leading fintech firms in Europe with 16 million active individual and corporate users,” she said. “I am so excited about this fact.” The company is in advanced negotiations to buy another European neobank, Ciravoglu said. “Then we can share with the public the exact amount of our valuation,” she said.

LandSpace Technology Corp. successfully launched the ZQ-2 rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwest province of Gansu on Wednesday, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The successful launch comes after the first attempt failed in December because of an abnormality in a supplementary second-stage engine. After reviews and analysis of the issue, improvement measures were implemented that proved effective in ground tests, the company said in March. The rocket arrived at the launch center in May after traveling nine days from LandSpace’s manufacturing base in Jiaxing. The launch entered its final-stage preparation on July 6, according to the company.   SpaceX and others have been developing rockets that can use methane-based fuel, thanks to its potential to be cleaner and safer than solid propellants, liquid hydrogen and other fuels currently used. The successful launch by LandSpace provides the Beijing-based company with bragging rights and boosts President Xi Jinping’s strategy to have China challenge the US in the race to dominate space. It’s “a major milestone,” said Maxime Puteaux, who researches the space industry as a principal advisor with Paris-based Euroconsult.

      "['Scroll through TikTok in Taiwan, and you’ll find a rolling stream of videos covering the heated campaign for next January’s presidential election.  That’s making the island the next battleground in the war over political disinformation and the debate over whether China’s government can manipulate the popular app to its advantage — a concern shared in Washington ahead of the 2024 US election. TikTok isn’t the most used social media platform on the island — Facebook and YouTube have more daily visitors — and disinformation cuts across social media apps. But TikTok’s Chinese ownership and its status as the fastest-growing app is drawing scrutiny as campaigning gets underway.   “The risk level of disinformation on a platform comes from its popularity, and for TikTok, that’s only growing,” said Billion Lee, co-founder of the Taiwanese fact-checking platform Cofacts. Sensing a potential threat, authorities in Taiwan already barred TikTok from government-issued devices, in line with moves by countries including the US. Now they are weighing national security and free speech concerns before deciding whether to go further.  In a statement to Bloomberg, the company said it complies with laws and regulations wherever it works and has policies to combat disinformation and “prevent misuse of the platform.”  “We are proactively reaching out to the relevant government agencies to share how TikTok protects user data and counters misinformation,” according to the statement. That includes “confirming the authenticity of accounts of political figures and parties with the relevant individuals and organizations.” The stakes are high heading into next year’s vote. US-China tensions have soared the past year, with Taiwan often at the center of those strains. Whoever wins could help influence how that relationship evolves in the years ahead.  Why Taiwan’s 2024 Election Matters From China to US: QuickTake Given its importance to China and its ties to the US, Taiwan “has long been used as a testing ground for disinformation,” said Robin Lee, project manager of the fact-checking platform MyGoPen.  Tsai Ming-yen, the head of Taiwan’s national security bureau, said this month that his agency reviewed more than 1,800 cases of online disinformation and disputed information across several platforms, including Facebook and YouTube. He said that was 1,400 more than the same period last year and that he expected those figures to keep rising.  After TikTok was banned from government devices, some officials argued it should be barred from the island entirely, but that appears to be a minority view for now.  “Taiwan must be very cautious when we make this decision,” said Lo Ping-cheng, the minister in charge of the government’s internal discussions on regulating TikTok. “There is no timetable set for a decision so far.” TikTok has already proven itself an influential platform in major elections. In Malaysia last year, conservative religious parties used the app to attract younger voters who helped them score some key upsets. On the other end of the political spectrum, Thailand’s progressive Move Forward party outperformed pre-election polls in May, in part through more effective use of the app.  Read More: French Lawmakers Give TikTok Six Months to Fix Security ConcernsBloomberg Terminal In the US and Europe, TikTok faces an existential crisis over worries that its feed can be manipulated for political purposes and that user data can be accessed by its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on behalf of the Chinese government.  The company has repeatedly denied it receives data requests from Beijing. In its statement to Bloomberg, it added that “Taiwanese user data is stored in the U.S., Singapore and Malaysia.”  With campaigning in Taiwan underway, one viral video, which garnered almost 900,000 views, highlights the challenge authorities face. The clip accused Vice President Lai Ching-te — the ruling party’s presidential candidate — of risking citizens’ lives in a potential war with China, while alleging his children would be protected because they live in the US and are American citizens. The party has repeatedly said the clip is false.  “Taiwanese people, it’s time to wake up,” the narrator says on the video, hosted on an account run by a 32-year-old Taiwanese engineer who posts under the pseudonym “Citizen V.” That’s a nod to the film V for Vendetta and its message of protesting political tyranny.  The clip was flagged in May by contributors at Cofacts for containing misinformation. After that designation, it was taken down, but by then it had circulated for more than a month. Officials are concerned a rising tide of misleading information will confound the ability of organizations and the government to stop them all.  Cofacts and MyGoPen are part of a constellation of non-profits focused on disinformation who say they are funded by individual donations and foundations, separate from any political party or group.  In an interview, “Citizen V” — who asked not to be identified by his real name — said he was frustrated that his video was singled out. He said he doesn’t see himself as peddling in disinformation but he does want to be an influencer in the election. And he found TikTok to be the best venue for getting his posts — many in support of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People’s Party — to a wider audience. Now the blogger has more than 48,000 followers and about 18 million views in the past two months on TikTok.   Citizen V’s case highlights the difficulty in separating heated rhetoric and misleading claims — part of elections everywhere — from state-sponsored disinformation.  Officials in Taipei have been warning since March about “large-scale” operations from China that seek to interfere with the election, an issue the government has long experience with. Taiwanese agencies faced a record number of cyberattacks after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited in August. Between Pelosi’s trip and local elections last November, the Taipei-based organization Doublethink Lab recorded nearly 3,000 instances of targeted disinformation.  “The most common tactic by China is to create greater confrontation between the major parties,” said Puma Shen, chairperson of Doublethink Lab, which tracks online disinformation. “Their main purpose is to undermine trust in Taiwan.” And while false information is prevalent across Taiwanese social media, usage of TikTok significantly impacts whether people in Taiwan view China positively or negatively, said Shen.  In a report on its website, TikTok said that last year it discovered an influence network of inauthentic accounts operating from Taiwan that primarily targeted Taiwanese audiences to “create a high number of derogatory comments in addition to sharing content in Traditional Chinese targeting civic discourse in Taiwan.” The network had amassed more than 60,000 followers before it was discovered internally and removed, the report said. Another combative and popular political TikTok account is “Taiwan Strait Number One Brother,” which posts videos promoting China’s People’s Liberation Army and criticizing the US. The majority of its nearly 700 posts are dubbed or subtitled in simplified Chinese, rather than the traditional form commonly used in Taiwan — a sign security experts say signals the content may be generated in China.  A person involved in managing the account declined to comment beyond saying that they were based outside of Taiwan.  Cybersecurity experts say it’s not easy to identify whether TikTok accounts are run by real-life political supporters or backed by a state, but the threat of election-related disinformation campaigns will only grow. “We’re seeing more conspiracy-type information that is a lot harder to fight back on,” said Robin Lee, project manager at MyGoPen. “A potential invasion sounds very scary, but is also something that could happen in the future — that you cannot actually fact-check.” ']\n",

      "['Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was among the US officials whose emails were breached in a hack of government accounts that Microsoft Corp. has said originated from China, according to a person familiar with the matter. Raimondo has been a prominent American figure implementing export curbs on advanced semiconductor technology to China, moves which Beijing has decried as undermining free trade and global supply chain stability. The person asked not to be identified discussing information that hasn’t been made public. A Commerce Department spokesperson declined to comment or confirm the breach of Raimondo’s emails, which was reported earlier by the Washington Post. Microsoft also declined to comment late Wednesday night.   The Commerce and State Departments as well as agencies in Western Europe were also attacked, according to government officials and Microsoft.  Commerce took immediate action after being notified by Microsoft that the department had been breached, the spokesperson said earlier Wednesday. When asked on Thursday about the claims that US officials were hacked, China’s Foreign Ministry said that “the US should account for its cyberattacks as soon as possible rather than spread false information and divert attention.” When a Huawei Bid Turned Into a Hunt for a Corporate Mole Last month, the US State Department identified anomalous activity and alerted Microsoft to the attack, according to a spokesperson, who said the agency had no reason to doubt that the hackers, who breached Microsoft Outlook accounts, were based in China.  “A subsequent investigation by the company determined that the hackers accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data from a small number of accounts,” according to a statement from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA. It wasn’t known what other US agencies were affected, but a senior official said the number was in the single digits. Hacking Campaign Raises Fears China is Prepping for Conflict (1) US officials described the attacks as targeted and focused on a small number of accounts at the agencies that were breached, as opposed to hack seeking to steal large amounts of data. CISA and the FBI issued a joint advisory urging organizations to harden their Microsoft 365 cloud environments. The hacking campaign got underway in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Beijing to meet with top officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to the officials. In a blog post published Tuesday night, Microsoft described the group behind the attack as China-based, calling it Storm-0558. The hackers were able to remain undetected for a month after gaining access to email data from around 25 organizations in mid-May. “We assess this adversary is focused on espionage, such as gaining access to email systems for intelligence collection,” Charlie Bell, an executive vice president at Microsoft, wrote in another post. It also wasn’t clear which European governments were affected. Italian cybersecurity officials said they were in contact with Microsoft “in order to identify potential Italian subjects involved in the latest attacks.” Asked about the findings, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a regular briefing on Wednesday, accused the US of being the world’s largest cyberattacker. The hackers used “forged authentication tokens to access user email using an acquired Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key,” Microsoft’s Bell said in his post. The hackers were then able to access Outlook email hosted on systems run and operated by Microsoft. But how hackers obtained the signing key that gave them access to these emails remains unknown. “The big question here really is where did they get the MSA-key to sign tokens,” said Sami Laiho, a computer security expert who specializes in Microsoft products. One possible explanation, Laiho said, is if Microsoft itself was breached. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about how hackers obtained the signing key. The senior official used the news of the breach to highlight a source of tension between Microsoft and the US government: logging. Logs allow cybersecurity investigators to dig through digital clues left behind on their own systems to figure out if they’ve been hacked and who may be responsible. More advanced logging can capture and record granular actions made by a user, like if a certain email was accessed. At issue is whether Microsoft should sell logging as a premium add-on for government customers or include it in its product for free. A lack of logging complicated the investigation into the so-called SolarWinds attack, which was disclosed in 2020. In that episode, Russian state-sponsored hackers installed a malicious update in software made by SolarWinds Corp., which installed a digital backdoor which they could then use to further infiltrate SolarWinds customers. Ultimately, nine US agencies about 100 companies were breached via the SolarWinds update and other methods. Microsoft offered its premium logging feature for free for about a year in the wake of the SolarWinds hack. CISA and others have said that logs should be free, maintaining that they are crucial for detecting and investigating security incidents. On Wednesday, the senior officials said some of the affected US agencies paid for a premium logging feature and were able to detect the breach on their own. Microsoft, which retains the logs, was able to identify others who were hacked but don’t pay for logging. Requiring organizations to pay for better logging is a recipe for inadequate visibility into what has occurred in networks, the official said, adding that the issue requires urgent attention.']\n",

      "['Two UK teenagers were accused of being key members of the notorious hacking group Lapsus$, with prosecutors alleging that the pair were involved in attacks on companies including Nvidia Corp., Rockstar Games Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc. Arion Kurtaj, 18, and a 17-year-old male, who can’t be named for legal reasons, were hit with joint charges including serious computer misuse, blackmail and fraud against BT Group Plc, and Nvidia.  Kurtaj is also separately accused of hacks into Uber, Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto, and fintech firm Revolut Ltd.  The pair are facing a criminal trial in London with prosecutors telling a jury that Kurtaj hacked into Revolut, Uber and Rockstar Games systems in September last year while he was already on bail for the other charges. The lawyers said Kurtaj — together with other unknown members of Lapsus$ — was responsible for stealing commercially sensitive code and video of the latest installment of the Grand Theft Auto series. It’s alleged he posed as a contractor at the firm and was responsible for leaking the hack on forums and soliciting a ransom payment.  Kurtaj was found unfit to stand trial due to medical reasons. That means a jury will only decide whether he is liable for the alleged crimes, rather than guilty of them. He will also avoid jail should he be found liable. The trial is set to last 8 weeks. A lawyer for Kurtaj didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment. Kurtaj’s name can only be reported after reporting restrictions on naming him were lifted Tuesday. The 17-year-old pleaded guilty to two charges relating to the BT hacks but not guilty to the others.  Prosecutors also claim the two teens together hacked into Nvidia in February 2022 by seizing control of two contractors’ accounts. The pair allegedly gained access to sensitive company data including some of the software building blocks of the company’s products.  The hackers stole as much as one terrabyte of data from Nvidia and publicly released some, prosecutors said. They then demanded a ransom payment, threatening to release the rest online if Nvidia didn’t comply, they added. Meanwhile, both teens allegedly hacked into the servers of BT’s EE network between July and November 2021 and threatened to release source code unless a ransom was paid. They also embarked on SIM swap frauds that drained multiple customers cryptocurrency and bank accounts, according to prosecutors. The pair were not just playing “juvenile pranks online” but were using a “very modern criminal method attempting to make money” from the firms, the lawyers told the jury. “Having hacked those companies, the group then attempted to blackmail them and threatened to publish confidential material online unless their demands were met,” said Kevin Barry, the prosecution’s lawyer. “They also used some of the material which they requested during the hacks for fraudulent purposes.” Prosecutors said police and investigators managed to link the hacks to the teenagers through IP addresses linked to various email addresses, mobile devices, and Telegram messaging platform accounts. The teens also regularly boasted online about the hacks. Kurtaj is “highly competent and a genius” but “he’s a teenage lad and he can’t resist bragging,” Barry said.  ']\n",

      "['Deutsche Bank AG, Commerzbank AG and ING Groep NV are among dozens of companies worldwide whose client data were compromised when a criminal hacking group exploited a security flaw in a file transfer tool. The attackers obtained access to data of thousands clients whose requests to change accounts had been transferred to an external data provider, which the banks in emails to Bloomberg identified as Majorel. The data seen by hackers included clients’ names and their account numbers, ING said in its statement. The software flaw has since been patched, the banks said.  “In the context of a security vulnerability in the MOVEit software that has affected many companies around the world, Majorel Germany was the target of a hacker attack,” a spokesperson for the company said. “The attack took place before the software’s vulnerability became public and only affected a single system running MOVEit software in Germany.” For a QuickTake on the MOVEit attack, click here. The MOVEit attack, which came to light more than a month ago and was allegedly carried out by a criminal hacking group known as Clop, has resulted in the theft of data from dozens of organizations and government agencies in the US and Europe. Notable victims include oil giant Shell PLC and British Airways, along with banks, manufacturing firms, and universities. The breach happens as banks are under pressure to strengthen their IT defenses amid a rising concern that cyber threats are getting more sophisticated and more frequent. The European Central Bank will hold its first cyber stress test of Europe’s banks early next year to map resilience in the industry.

      "['Subscribe to Foundering on Apple or Spotify.   In his final days,  John McAfee traversed Europe with his partner Janice, knowing a return to the US could mean life behind bars. He engaged in shady crypto deals and maintained a flamboyant public persona that was provocative and defiant. But the net was tightening. Fighting the courts, he traded in conspiracies and was increasingly desperate and isolated. The final episode of Foundering: The John McAfee Story explores his legacy and the mysteries surrounding his death. Google’s Bard artificial intelligence chatbot will answer a question about how many pandas live in zoos quickly, and with a surfeit of confidence. Ensuring that the response is well-sourced and based on evidence, however, falls to thousands of outside contractors from companies including Appen Ltd. and Accenture Plc, who can make as little as $14 an hour and labor with minimal training under frenzied deadlines, according to several contractors, who declined to be named for fear of losing their jobs. The contractors are the invisible backend of the generative AI boom that’s hyped to change everything. Chatbots like Bard use computer intelligence to respond almost instantly to a range of queries spanning all of human knowledge and creativity. But to improve those responses so they can be reliably delivered again and again, tech companies rely on actual people who review the answers, provide feedback on mistakes and weed out any inklings of bias. It’s an increasingly thankless job. Six current Google contract workers said that as the company entered a AI arms race with rival OpenAI over the past year, the size of their workload and complexity of their tasks increased. Without specific expertise, they were trusted to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Documents shared with Bloomberg show convoluted instructions that workers must apply to tasks with deadlines for auditing answers that can be as short as three minutes. “As it stands right now, people are scared, stressed, underpaid, don’t know what’s going on,” said one of the contractors. “And that culture of fear is not conducive to getting the quality and the teamwork that you want out of all of us.” Google has positioned its AI products as public resources in health, education and everyday life. But privately and publicly, the contractors have raised concerns about their working conditions, which they say hurt the quality of what users see. One Google contract staffer who works for Appen said in a letter to Congress in May that the speed at which they are required to review content could lead to Bard becoming a “faulty” and “dangerous” product. Google has made AI a major priority across the company, rushing to infuse the new technology into its flagship products after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google opened up Bard to 180 countries and territories and unveiled experimental AI features in marquee products like search, email and Google Docs. Google positions itself as superior to the competition because of its access to “the breadth of the world’s knowledge.”  “We undertake extensive work to build our AI products responsibly, including rigorous testing, training, and feedback processes we’ve honed for years to emphasize factuality and reduce biases,” Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said in a statement. The company said it isn’t only relying on the raters to improve the AI, and that there are a number of other methods for improving its accuracy and quality. Read More:  Google’s Rush to Win in AI Led to Ethical Lapses, Employees Say To prepare for the public using these products, workers said they started getting AI-related tasks as far back as January. One trainer, employed by Appen, was recently asked to compare two answers providing information about the latest news on Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care, rating the responses by helpfulness and relevance. Workers are also frequently asked to determine whether the AI model’s answers contain verifiable evidence. Raters are asked to decide whether a response is helpful based on six-point guidelines that include analyzing answers for things like specificity, freshness of information and coherence.  They are also asked to make sure the responses don’t “contain harmful, offensive, or overly sexual content,” and don’t “contain inaccurate, deceptive, or misleading information.” Surveying the AI’s responses for misleading content should be “based on your current knowledge or quick web search,” the guidelines say. “You do not need to perform a rigorous fact check” when assessing the answers for helpfulness. The example answer to “Who is Michael Jackson?” included an inaccuracy about the singer starring in the movie “Moonwalker” — which the AI said was released in 1983. The movie actually came out in 1988. “While verifiably incorrect,” the guidelines state, “this fact is minor in the context of answering the question, ‘Who is Michael Jackson?’” Even if the inaccuracy seems small, “it is still troubling that the chatbot is getting main facts wrong,” said  Alex Hanna, the director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and a former Google AI ethicist. “It seems like that’s a recipe to exacerbate the way these tools will look like they’re giving details that are correct, but are not,” she said.  Raters say they are assessing high-stakes topics for Google’s AI products.  One of the examples in the instructions, for instance, talks about evidence that a rater could use to determine the right dosages for a medication to treat high blood pressure, called Lisinopril. Google said that some workers concerned about accuracy of content may not have been training specifically for accuracy, but for tone, presentation and other attributes it tests. “Ratings are deliberately performed on a sliding scale to get more precise feedback to improve these models,” the company said. “Such ratings don’t directly impact the output of our models and they are by no means the only way we promote accuracy.”  Read the contract staffers’ instructions for training Google’s generative AI here:   Ed Stackhouse, the Appen worker who sent the letter to Congress, said in an interview that contract staffers were being asked to do AI labeling work on Google’s products “because we’re indispensable to AI as far as this training.” But he and other workers said they appeared to be graded for their work in mysterious, automated ways. They have no way to communicate with Google directly, besides providing feedback in a “comments” entry on each individual task. And they have to move fast. “We’re getting flagged by a type of AI telling us not to take our time on the AI,” Stackhouse added. Google disputed the workers’ description of being automatically flagged by AI for exceeding time targets. At the same time, the company said that Appen is responsible for all performance reviews for employees. Appen did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Accenture said the company does not comment on client work. Other technology companies training AI products also hire human contractors to improve them. In January,  Time reported that laborers in Kenya, paid $2 an hour, had worked to make ChatGPT less toxic. Other tech giants, including Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. make use of subcontracted staff to moderate social network content and product reviews, and to provide technical support and customer service. “If you want to ask, what is the secret sauce of Bard and ChatGPT? It’s all of the internet. And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

John McAfee came away from his failed presidential run with a newfound interest in digital currencies and set up a crypto operation in his Tennessee home. At the same time, he was becoming increasingly dependent on synthetic drugs, people close to him said. The resulting delusions and hallucinations cost him relationships. His crypto business waded deep into the grayest waters of the industry, where regulators had yet to define rules. Marketing and promotional schemes — and his public refusals to pay taxes — put him in the crosshairs of law enforcement.

The campaign had an awkward start, but he soon adapted and gained the support of several influential people in the party. McAfee used the publicity he got from the national campaign to amplify prospective business opportunities.

And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

      "['China has loosened some of the guardrails it proposed for ChatGPT-style services months ago, as it acknowledges the need to compete for global leadership in artificial intelligence. The finalized guidelines, one of the world’s first major moves to regulate the nascent technology, removed some specific restrictions from the initial draft released in April, signaling a more flexible and accommodating approach. The 24 guidelines, set out in a statement Thursday, will go into effect on Aug. 15 and will be overseen by seven state agencies, led by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the nation’s top internet regulator. The National Development and Reform Commission along with the country’s education, science and technology ministries have also been added in the final version. Among the various provisions are requirements for platform providers to carry out a security review and register their services with the government, as was required in the April draft. While the final edition still places much of the regulatory burden on platforms, it injects a focus on development and innovation alongside security safeguards for the strategic AI industry, which lies at the core of Beijing’s tech rivalry with Washington. “The final version of the law significantly watered down many stringent requirements in the earlier draft released by the CAC, sending a strong signal of cautious and tolerant approach in the oversight of generative AI,” said Angela Zhang, director of the Center for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong. Offshore providers of generative AI tools — if they are aimed at Chinese residents — must also comply with the set of rules, but Chinese-developed tools that only serve overseas users are exempted. “This means more opportunities will be in enterprise-facing applications and people will be more cautious about consumer-facing entrepreneurship,” said Frances Du, founding partner of J Ventures. “However, now that there are seven agencies involved, that will make it harder to gauge the specific execution style.” The official guidelines remove provisions from the draft that included fines as high as 100,000 yuan ($14,000) for violations, as well as the requirement for platform operators to act within a three-month grace period to rectify problematic content. The articles encourage “the use of secure and trustworthy chips, software, tools, algorithms, and data sources,” and urge China’s developers of AI chips, models and software to help set international standards and pursue technological exchange.

China’s major internet companies, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to JD.com Inc., have jumped into the frenzy to build the country’s equivalent to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. China’s regulation of the nascent sector will offer one model for the orderly development of AI and its distribution as a service for businesses and consumers. Legal experts had raised concerns after the draft version of the regulations, saying it placed the bulk of responsibility for governing AI content on the platform operators. The fear is that overly onerous regulations could limit the industry’s development, at a time when China is seeking to catch up to and surpass the US in the technology. You Chuanman, director of the IIA Center for Regulation and Global Governance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Shenzhen campus, said the final version of the regulations appeared to allow greater flexibility by removing specifics in the grace period and by adding a greater focus on promoting development. “A clear-cut deadline of three months could be a daunting challenge,” You said. “In the overall content, there are quite a few additions of clauses to promote development, and there is more emphasis placed on the use of existing legal tools.” Changes in the final guidelines:']\n",

      "['The absence of a foldable phone in Apple Inc.’s portfolio is creating an opening for rivals to overtake the iPhone maker, according to Honor Device Co.’s chief executive officer. The Shenzhen-based firm on Wednesday rolled out its latest foldable device, the Magic V2, which measures less than 10mm thick. The phone has a regular glass display comparable to the iPhone 14 Pro on its exterior and a 7.92-inch foldable OLED screen on the inside. The Magic V2 starts at 8,999 yuan ($1,254.5) in China, the same price as the iPhone 14 Pro Max. “The product has only one targeted competitor — Apple’s topmost flagship phones,” Honor CEO George Zhao said in an interview ahead of the unveiling. “As strong as Apple is, it can’t fulfill all demands from consumers.” Honor, once a sub-brand of Huawei Technologies Co., spun off from the telecom equipment provider in late 2020 after US sanctions choked off Huawei’s access to advanced chips. As an independent entity, Honor is not subject to the same curbs, and the Magic V2 is powered by Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon 5G chipset. The world’s major Android phone brands, from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp., have all introduced a variety of foldable models, leaving Apple the only top vendor without such an offering. Foldables took only a fraction of global smartphone shipments last year, but the potential is growing. Their larger screens are a selling point to help Android manufacturers ask higher prices and increase their typically paper-thin margins. More than 21 million foldable phones will be shipped this year and the category is on track to more than double by 2027, research firm IDC estimated. “Similar to the rise of electric cars, foldables have created a new arena in the smartphone industry,” Zhao said. Chinese smartphone consumers have long prioritized higher specifications and larger displays when making their purchase decision. Apple’s iPhone is one of the top-selling devices in the country, though the market is competitive enough for the leader in sales to change regularly. Honor was the only major brand that grew shipments in Covid-stricken China last year, defying a double-digit slump that delivered a decade low for the market. Smartphone makers are facing an even fiercer fight in 2023 as the cooling economy suppresses demand.  The company is mulling plans to sell the Magic V2 in overseas markets as well as in China, and Europe will be a key part of its expansion this year, said Zhao.']\n",

      "['Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh installment of the action franchise starring Tom Cruise as an elite spy, took in $56.2 million in US and Canadian theaters over its debut weekend. That compares with projections of $61 million to $75 million in ticket sales for the Friday-to-Sunday period from forecaster Boxoffice Pro. The movie generated $80 million over the five days since its release on July 12. Paramount Pictures, which distributed the film, had projected $90 million for that stretch.  Previous installments of the Mission: Impossible took in $44.9 million to $78.8 million in their first five days, according to data provided by Comscore Inc. International sales came to $155 million, the studio said in a statement Sunday.  The picture has been one of the theater industry’s most-anticipated of the year. It scored positive reviews, with critic and audience scores sitting at 96% and 94%, respectively, on Rotten Tomatoes. Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing picture last year domestically.  The second highest-grossing film of the weekend was Sound of Freedom, which has grossed more than $85 million over its two-week run. The low-budget action picture, in which a former US government agent rescues children from a sex trafficking operation in Colombia, is a major success story for the two-year-old distributor Angel Studios and sold more than twice as many tickets in the US and Canada this weekend as Walt Disney Co.’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which cost an estimated $300 million to make.  In Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise races to find a powerful weapon that threatens to destroy humanity. He stars alongside Hayley Atwell and Ving Rhames.  A number of high-profile releases this summer have disappointed, including Disney’s Elemental and Warner Bros.’ The Flash. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts downgraded their predictions for the theater industry’s revenue to about $9 billion this year as a result. Before the pandemic, the domestic box office regularly topped $11 billion annually.  Mission: Impossible cost $290 million to produce, a number high even by the standards of Hollywood blockbusters and one likely to fuel debate about whether budgets like that are sustainable given the ongoing weakness in ticket sales.  The balance of summer moviegoing now rests on two highly anticipated releases next weekend, Warner Bros.’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer. Barbie is projected to bring in as much as $426 million domestically, and Oppenheimer as much as $194 million, according to Boxoffice Pro.']\n",

      "['For the first time in more than 60 years, Hollywood writers and actors are on strike at the same time. Members of the Writers Guild of America haven’t worked since May 2, when talks with Hollywood studios fell apart. The Screen Actors Guild joined the writers on strike July 13 following unsuccessful negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major Hollywood studios such as Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. The last time both writers and actors staged simultaneous walkouts was in 1960 when they were pushing to get revenue for films that aired on TV.  Actors and writers are seeking increases in their base pay as well as a greater share of earnings from shows that appear on streaming services. Both are also seeking protections against studios using artificial intelligence to replace their jobs. The writers say that their pay has fallen over the past decade; they’re seeking a minimum commitment of six writers and 13 weeks of work for each show, plus a 5% increase in base pay and additional compensation for hit shows on streaming, which they say studios rejected in negotiations. Additional demands by actors include compensation for auditions that they record themselves. SAG President Fran Drescher said compensation from streaming was a key issue as online video entertainment takes predominance over broadcast and cable TV.  They will drive most US film and TV production to a halt, with the exception of unscripted and reality programs. The Writers Guild estimates that the work stoppage by writers alone represents lost output of $30 million per day. The last writers’ strike in 2007, which lasted 100 days, cost the California economy about $2.1 billion. Actors working on reality TV or game shows may still be permitted to work but also may feel pressure to join the strike in solidarity. Companies that work primarily with the entertainment industry, such as sound stages, will be hit.  Talent agencies started implementing layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts to offset costs. Some studios stopped or reduced payments to producers. In addition to halting production on shows, the strikes also limit film and TV marketing, since SAG’s 160,000 members aren’t allowed to promote any projects through premieres, awards shows and other events. That includes promotion at live events like premieres, festivals and conventions, as well as virtual marketing on social media. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and other stars of Oppenheimer, one of the most important theatrical releases of the year, left its London premiere before the screening began on July 13, even though they were at the red carpet earlier.  Though some production on projects that were already written could continue during the writers strike, any remaining scripted domestic production will come to a halt without actors. As that happens, networks and streaming services will be more reliant on reality TV and other unscripted shows. Some streaming giants, such as Netflix, will still have content ready for the fall because of the length of time between production and release. Fox’s fall lineup consists only of reality TV shows and animated shows that were already completed before the strikes began. Evening comedy shows such as The Tonight Show were the first casualty of the writers strike, opting to air reruns in place of new episodes beginning in May. Studios including Disney had already begun to push out the release dates of films they haven’t finished. The strikes will have little immediate impact on the release of scripted content that is already completed. The strikes mark an end to the streaming boom, which began in 2013 with the release of Netflix’s first original series, House of Cards. Streaming services are at the end of a decade of record production numbers. At the same time, the entertainment industry is facing declining audiences for traditional TV networks and losses from a new generation of streaming services including Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s Max and Disney+. Major entertainment companies have been cutting down on staff over the past 18 months and pulling content off their streaming services as cost-cutting measures.  For writers, there are concerns that AI could generate scripts without them. For actors, there are concerns that studios could use AI to replicate previous performances. The Directors Guild of America, which agreed to a new contract with the studios in June, got the companies to agree AI would not replace them. SAG representatives said the studios had offered to pay background actors for just one day’s work, and that their likenesses could then be replicated again and again in a film. ']\n",

      "['For the first time in six decades, Hollywood writers and actors are on strike at the same time — a cataclysm for hundreds of thousands of film and TV workers already idled by the entertainment industry’s growing labor strife. The Screen Actors Guild, which represents some 160,000 performers, announced a walkout Thursday after failing to reach a new labor agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, which represents studios including Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc. The strike begins at midnight. The Writers Guild of America, meanwhile has been on strike since May 2, shutting down late-night TV programs like The Tonight Show, halting many projects in progress and imperiling the traditional release of new broadcast TV shows starting in September. In a statement after the strike announcement, the studio alliance said the union “has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.” The studios say they offered double-digit percentage increases in salaries and higher pension and health benefits, as well as a boost in residuals — the money actors and others receive when shows and movies are rerun. They also offered protections against the use of actors’ digital likenesses — addressing fears about artificial intelligence. At their press conference, SAG officials suggested the sides remain far apart, with compensation from streaming a key issue as online video entertainment takes predominance over broadcast and cable TV. Regarding artificial intelligence, the union said the studios offered to pay background actors for just one day’s work, and that their likenesses could then be replicated again and again in a film. “I cannot believe how far apart we are in so many things,” Fran Drescher, the union’s president, said at the conference. “The entire business model has been changed by streaming. This is a moment of history. That is a moment of truth.” Work on dozens of popular programs has already been halted including ABC’s Abbott Elementary and Netflix’s Stranger Things. Fox on Tuesday unveiled a fall TV lineup that consists entirely of reality shows and animated programs already completed. The impact of the simultaneous strikes, if they last more than a few days, is likely to be wider than the walkout by the writers alone. Programs already written could still be filmed without screenwriters, but not without actors.  Actors will also have to stop promoting upcoming projects, such as at film premieres, awards shows and events like San Diego Comi-Con International, scheduled for next week. Programs shot overseas could be impacted. And while other contracts may allow actors appearing in game shows or reality TV to continue working, they may get pressured to join the strike in sympathy with their colleagues.  Matt Damon and Emily Blunt had to leave the Thursday night UK premiere of Oppenheimer to “write their picket signs,” director Christopher Nolan said from the stage. Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon, Rob Lowe and Mark Ruffalo are among the stars who’ve already walked picket lines supporting the writers. Other unions, including IATSE, which represents some 168,000 stagehands and other entertainment industry workers, have put out statements backing the actors as well. “The longer it goes, it will just become a snowballing issue,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Kevin Near. The great Hollywood walkout is part of a larger battle that has seen workers fighting for better pay and benefits from businesses as far flung as Starbucks Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. A union representing about 340,000 United Parcel Service Inc. workers is threatening a strike on Aug. 1 if the company doesn’t meet wage-increase demands in talks to renew a five-year labor contract.  The entertainment industry is struggling to cope with two related problems: declining audiences for traditional TV networks and staggering losses from a new generation of streaming services like Disney+ and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s Max. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger on Thursday said the strike will have a “very, very damaging effect on the whole industry.” “This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption,” Iger said in a CNBC interview. Every major entertainment company has fired staff in the last 18 months, and many of them have pulled programming from their streaming services to cut costs.  In a way, the dual strikes mark a sad finale to a boom in film and TV that started when Netflix jumped into original production with House of Cards in 2013 and spurred a decade of record production. Both the actors and writers say they’ve been shortchanged by the transition to streaming — and want to be paid a share of companies’ earnings from shows. They’re also seeking protection against the use of artificial intelligence, which they see as a threat to their jobs. The last time writers and actors walked out together was in 1960, when SAG was led by Ronald Reagan. Both were fighting for revenue from movies that aired on TV, according to the Los Angeles Times. The last strike by writers, a 100-day walkout that began in 2007, cost the California economy an estimated $2.1 billion in lost output. The guild now projects the cost at $30 million a day, based on its members alone. The stoppage has hit companies that work with the film and TV industry, including owners of studio space like Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. Talent agencies have imposed layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts.  In New York, home to TV productions like Law & Order and Blue Bloods, the number of permits to shoot films, TV shows and commercials fell 43% in June from their 2022 level. FilmLA, which administers permits for projects in Los Angeles, said its permit count was down 64% in the first week of July. No scripted TV series were filming that week. In the short run, the strikes could boost profits for the media giants. With filming shut down, they won’t have movie and TV production costs yet can continue to collect revenue from cable TV distributors, advertisers and program syndication sales, even if they’re airing reruns or other shows. “As long as they have content, they’re going to continue to make money,” said Chris Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics, a research firm. Still, the inability to commission and shoot new programming will begin to weigh on the industry in the months ahead. Media companies rely on fresh programming to attract and keep viewers or fill seats in movie theaters. Streaming services have already spaced out new releases but face a major shortfall in 2024 if they can’t get production up and running before the fall. Although the Directors Guild of America reached a new contract last month that included a pay hike of 5% in the first year, the writers and actors have shown less willingness to deal. “In general, labor is not in a mood to be conciliatory at this point in time given the tightness of labor markets,” Beacon’s Thornberg said.']\n",

Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is his latest salvo against OpenAI, currently the buzziest and best-funded player in the fast-growing industry.  During the discussion, Musk and staffers of his new startup spoke in lofty terms about the mission of xAI. Though it does not yet have any products, the startup unveiled a new website this week, and has the goal of safely developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI. The plan is “to build a good AGI with the overarching purpose of just trying to understand the universe,” Musk said. Later, he added, “I guess you could reform the xAI mission statement as: ‘What the hell is really going on?’ That’s our goal.” The concept of AGI, technology able to understand or learn tasks that humans can, has delighted and terrified scientists — even though it’s still only theoretical. On Friday, Musk’s new employees were bullish on the technology. Greg Yang, a former Microsoft Corp. engineer, compared the current state of AI development to the invention of quantum physics and general relativity. At times during the conversation, some of Musk’s statements bordered on the outlandish. “Why is there not massive evidence of aliens?” he asked at one point. Musk has had a famously hot-and-cold relationship with artificial intelligence. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, then a few years later left its board, and has criticized the company. In March, the billionaire added his name to a call for a six-month pause on some AI development — then less than six month later, he officially launched xAI.  The 12 early staffers of xAI, including Musk, are all men and all have a background in the industry. A majority previously worked at Alphabet Inc.’s Google and DeepMind in some capacity.  One concern in the industry has been the relative concentration of AI research. One xAI staffer — Kyle Kosic, formerly of OpenAI — said he was looking forward to more competition in the field. “The reason I’m particularly excited about xAI is that I think the biggest danger of AI is monopolization by a couple of entities,” Kosic said.

      "['Hi everyone. Today we’re talking about the latest viral indie game and what it says about our desire to work. But first…  This week’s top gaming news: A lot of us wouldn’t choose to work for free in our off hours — unless it’s in a video game.  Dave the Diver, published by a division of Nexon Co., is the hot new game tearing up the charts with over a million downloads in 10 days. That’s bonkers for an unassuming, little game about making sushi and collecting fish. The moment I loaded it up, I got it. Dave the Diver scratches the part of my brain that needs to feel productive while lowering the stakes down to, “Can I sell enough Parrotfish nigiri to buy cute restaurant chairs?” The reception has been effusive on Valve’s PC marketplace Steam, where the game has 33,000 positive reviews. “I stopped playing Zelda to play this,” wrote one fan. (Dave the Diver comes to Nintendo’s Switch console later this year.) Games about doing jobs have always been popular, but never more so than now. In a recent Gamers With Jobs podcast, host Amanda Knowlton pointed out that there’s “a lot of capitalism going on in games,” referencing a couple other new games built around gathering resources and selling products, or accomplishing an everyday task. One of last year’s viral games was PowerWash Simulator, which drew in seven million players. And we’re on Farming Simulator 22. Knowlton’s observation reminded me of an article I wrote in 2016 for VICE in which I interviewed a truck driver, a city planner and a soldier about why they played American Truck Simulator, SimCity BuildIt and military simulator Arma 3. Here’s what the trucker told me: “The actual trucking experience cannot always be that pleasant. It has its moments when you just want to strangle people.” In American Truck Simulator, he said, “You take your job. You hook up your trailer and you go on.”  Games can distill the things we like about capitalism, or are conditioned to like, into neat processes and goals: gather fish, design menu, serve food, earn money, upgrade restaurant. Processes streamline. Numbers go up. Things get nicer.  Games and capitalism go hand-in-hand, said Rachel Kowert, research director for the gaming and mental health organization Take This. She cited something called “self determination theory,” which posits that human motivation is defined by autonomy, relatedness and accomplishment.  “Games are really good at hitting all three,” she said.  “These job simulation games are really good especially at the autonomy and the sense of achievement,” she added. “Basically, you’re doing labor without the bad parts of doing labor.” A fan of farming simulator Stardew Valley herself, Kowert acknowledged that the game offers a mental model for success without repercussions like losing your life’s savings.  Dave the Diver is, of course, more than its sticky gameplay loop. It’s mirthful and funny, brought to life by hilarious pixel-art cutscenes and surly characters. But there is the undeniable dopamine tick from selling lots and lots of sushi. “What is making money if not the most basic signpost of being successful in capitalist society?” Kowert said. “That’s driven into us in the very beginning.” I told you already! Voice actors on miHoYo’s hit game Genshin Impact said they’re owed money. The company responded that it is attempting to resolve the matter.

      "['Western Digital Corp. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. — after months of talks — aim to reach a merger agreement by August, according to people familiar with the matter.  The deal would be structured as a tax-free spinoff of Western Digital’s flash business, which would merge with Kioxia, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the details are private. Western Digital shareholders would own slightly more than 50% of the merged entity, the people said. Shares of Western Digital, which had fallen more than 14% in the past year, rose as much as 6.5% in trading Friday. The shares closed up 0.8% to $39.66 in New York, giving the company a market value of about $12.7 billion. The company would be run by Kioxia executives on a day-to-day basis, with Western Digital executives also being involved, the people added. Financing is in place, they said.  Both chipmakers would have board representation and the combined company would be domiciled in Japan, they said. The merged entity would trade on the Nasdaq initially but eventually list in Tokyo, they said. Bain Capital, which backs Kioxia, would be paid a special dividend, they said. A final agreement hasn’t been reached and the timing could change, or talks could still end without one, the people added. Closely held Kioxia, also backed by Toshiba Corp., was spun out of Toshiba in 2018. Representatives for Western Digital and Bain declined to comment. Kioxia and Toshiba didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  The companies, which have a joint venture that produces flash chips, have been circling each other for years and joining forces would help them take on Samsung Electronics Co. Last year, Western Digital announced a review of strategic alternatives following talks with activist investor Elliott Investment Management. Bloomberg News reported in January that Western Digital and Kioxia had revived merger talks, after discussing a pairing in 2021. ']\n",

      "['AT&T Inc. shares hit an almost three-decade low Friday amid growing concerns of the potentially high costs the phone giant faces if it must clean up contamination due to lead-clad wiring throughout parts of its nationwide network. The issue was exposed earlier this week in a Wall Street Journal storyBloomberg Terminal that pointed to leaching lead cables that were part of early landline networks built by phone companies in the first half of the 20th century. Those networks are now owned by several national carriers including AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc. and Lumen Technologies Inc.  AT&T shares fell 4.1% to $14.50 at the close in New York, their lowest price since February 1994. Verizon declined 1.8% and Lumen dropped 10%. Industry analysts have been trying to calculate the potential costs and risks that may await the carriers.  With a service area that covers about 40% of US homes plus an extensive long distance network, “AT&T will have the largest exposure,” JPMorgan analyst Phil Cusick wrote in a note Friday. Citing the uncertainty around the outcome, Cusick cut his AT&T target price to $17 from $22. The lead concerns add to an already challenging year for the largest US phone company. In April, AT&T reported $1 billion in free cash flow, missing analysts’ $3 billion target and setting off alarms for the second year in a row about dividend payments. Last month, the company warned that wireless subscriber growth was less than anticipatedBloomberg Terminal. The company also clumsily obscured a massive restructuring and job reduction effort behind a new return-to-work policy.  AT&T declined to comment. The company has referred questions about the lead situation to USTelecom, an industry group, which has created a website featuring several statements including a claim disputing the charge that phone cables are a leading cause of lead exposure. The group, which represents most US phone companies, says it’s “ready to engage constructively on the issue.”']\n",

      "['ASML Holding NV, the leading provider of chipmaking equipment, is facing tighter restrictions on its ability to work with Chinese customers, a further escalation in the technology clash between Washington and Beijing.  Dutch export control rules will forbid ASML from maintaining, repairing and providing spare parts for controlled equipment without government approval, people familiar with the matter said. Those restrictions are related to new regulations the government published in June that prohibit ASML from shipping some so-called immersion deep ultraviolet lithography machines, its second-most capable machinery, to China without a license beginning in September.  In addition to the Dutch controls, the US is expected to bar ASML from selling even older DUV lithography gear to about half a dozen of Chinese plants without approval from Washington, said the people, asking not to be named because the rules aren’t yet public. Among the China plants the Biden administration is targeting is one operated by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., one of the country’s leading chip companies. The dual curbs come on top of sweeping export restrictions President Joe Biden administration’s imposed on China last year and threaten to degrade the Chinese semiconductor companies’ capabilities over time. The Communist Party has reacted furiously to the technology curbs, filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization and arguing the US is trying to keep China subservient. “The Dutch regulations are an official stake in the ground that the Netherlands does not want China to be able to produce the most advanced semiconductors,” said Dylan Patel, founder of the research group SemiAnalysis. “Without access to these machines, Chinese chip companies will be at a significant disadvantage in the global market for advanced logic and memory chips.” ASML is the leading producer of the lithography equipment needed to produce semiconductors for the most advanced smartphones, computers and other tech gear. The restricted DUV models include the TWINSCAN NXT:2000i and more sophisticated machines. Such equipment is capable of crafting chips as advanced as 5-nanometer, a technology that first became available in 2020.  “I anticipate that the new restrictions will significantly impact Chinese chip companies’ future plans,” Patel said. “They will likely be forced to delay or cancel the development of certain future leading-edge process technologies.” ASML has never been able to sell its most advanced chipmaking machines to China, which use extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography. That’s because the US and its allies are worried these technologies could be used to advance Chinese military capabilities. The Biden administration will impose the new curbs on ASML by invoking the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows it to limit foreign-equipment suppliers’ sales if their products contain even a small amount of American components, the people said. Reuters previously reported some details of the new US moves to limit ASML’s China business.  Previously, Donald Trump’s administration adopted the FDPR measure to prevent chipmakers using any US tech companies from providing manufacturing services to Huawei Technologies Co. without approval. That move essentially kneecapped the Chinese telecom giant’s once lucrative smartphone business.  The US may also ban ASML from providing maintenance and repair services and supplying spare parts for the restricted machines installed at the six targeted plants without a license, according to one of those people. It is unclear when the US will move ahead with these additional restrictions, the people said.  While the Netherlands had earlier resisted US efforts to apply extra-territorial controls on ASML, the administrations of Biden and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte reached an understanding about the national security necessities of additional restrictions, the people said. The new Dutch regulations are not expected to be affected by the recent collapse of the country’s coalition government.  Representatives for the Dutch government, the US Department of Commerce and ASML declined to comment. Separately this week, ASML said it plans to slow hiring this year due to a downturn in the chip industry and a massive recruiting drive in 2022.  In addition to deterring China from upgrading its semiconductor technology, the new US-Dutch controls may reduce Chinese firms’ existing production capacity for relatively advanced chips over time. The country has limited domestic alternatives for repairing or replacing broken foreign equipment. ASML has a virtual monopoly on critical lithography gear that’s required to make both advanced and legacy chips around the world.  The Biden administration imposed similar controls on the maintenance and repair of American chipmaking with its original export control rules in October. Those restrictions affected ASML’s US peers, including Applied Materials Inc. ']\n",

      "['      The most interesting rivalry in social media right now goes deeper than cage matches. It’s that the very existence of Threads and its immediate success — 100 million users in four days — is thanks in no small part to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who set off a chain of events that led to the deterioration of his creation and a big opportunity for Mark Zuckerberg. It goes all the way back to 2005, when Zuckerberg asked a Stanford University student named Kevin Systrom if he would come work at Zuckerberg’s company, Facebook. Systrom said no — he wanted to stay in school — and ended up interning with the team that would create Twitter, befriending Dorsey. When Twitter started catching on, Zuckerberg noticed. He tried to buy it in 2008 for $500 million. Twitter said no. Systrom eventually co-founded his own app, Instagram. Dorsey championed the app and promoted it on Twitter to all of his friends and followers. Dorsey believed in Instagram so deeply that he agreed to be one of its first investors at Systrom’s invitation. Dorsey tried to get Twitter to buy it. Systrom wasn’t interested. But in 2012, right after Systrom rejected Twitter’s third overture, Zuckerberg offered $1 billion, an unimaginable sum for a mobile app at the time. Systrom said yes. When he heard the news, Dorsey was crushed. He stopped posting there and ended his friendship with Systrom. In the years that followed, Instagram got even more popular, including with celebrities — one of Twitter’s sweet spots. Zuckerberg built Twitter-like features into Facebook and continued to grow well beyond Twitter’s size. Dorsey returned to Twitter as chief executive officer in 2015 and remained sad about the state of social media and Facebook’s consolidation of power. He laid the groundwork there for a new kind of social networking framework via a project called Bluesky, built on an open system any developer could plug into. Life running a public Twitter, appeasing shareholders and activist investors, began to wear on Dorsey. He started chatting with his friend Elon Musk about whether anything could be done. Musk, of course, took on the challenge. Dorsey initially said Musk was the “singular solution” he trusted to take Twitter private. But again, Dorsey would be disappointed: Musk slashed Twitter’s staff, stopped paying its bills, introduced confusing content rules and spurned longtime users. Twitter, facing technical issues under Musk, was at its most vulnerable — and that’s when Zuckerberg struck. Threads launched via Instagram, promising to build on an open protocol. Zuckerberg had three great reasons to swoop in on Twitter: Musk’s stumbles, Instagram’s super-powerful network and the new popularity of open-source versions of Twitter — and remarkably, Dorsey had a hand in all three. Trained on vast amounts of information, large language models identify language patterns, and then use them to convincingly mimic the way people communicate. Check out our simplified depiction of the process. A Stability AI founder sued the company, claiming he was tricked into selling his stake for $100, just months before the British AI startup hit a $1 billion valuation. US shoppers spent $12.7 billion online during Amazon.com’s 48-hour Prime Day, up 6.1% from a year ago but short of estimates for 9.5% growth, according to Adobe. China loosened some of the guardrails it proposed for ChatGPT-style services months ago, as it acknowledges the need to compete for global leadership in AI.

      "['In New York, an Upper East Side enclave is fighting city plans for curbside 5G towers, calling them “garish” and unnecessary, in a campaign that presages battles around the US sparked by an explosion in wireless gear on public streets. Carnegie Hill, which stretches from Fifth Avenue’s Museum Mile along Central Park into tranquil tree-lined blocks, is home to luminaries such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and private equity titan Ken Chenault. Swept sidewalks adorned with flower boxes front graceful condo buildings and Andrew Carnegie’s mansion, which ratified the quarter as upscale when it was built 120 years ago. The neighborhood is working to fend off its share of some 2,000 cell towers to be deployed around the city. At 32 feet high (9.8 meters), the structures are tall enough to loom outside a bedroom window. “They are awful, ugly, Brutalist” and out of context in a historic neighborhood, said Joanna Cawley, executive director of the local civic group Carnegie Hill Neighbors. The neighborhood, one of more than a dozen around the city fighting the plan, has engaged a public relations firm and started a “Stop 5G Towers Fund.”  The structures are part of efforts to expand access to reliable, high-speed Wi-Fi and cellphone service, especially in underserved areas. The city accuses critics of NIMBYism, referring to a “not-in-my-backyard” mentality. The project is run by a group called CityBridge LLC, with roots including Google funding, that’s under city contract and operates using the LinkNYC label. Similar tensions are set to be repeated across the country, as wireless providers move to blanket cities and towns with access to fast 5G — and with the gear to broadcast its signals, which rapidly lose strength and peter out within a few hundred feet. The new network needs an abundance of transmitting cell sites, which are typically the size of a backpack and affixed to tall poles or traffic lights.  “We’re going to continue to see conflict” between a city or an internet service provider “and residents who don’t want to see a pole in their front yard,” said Angelina Panettieri, legislative director, information technology and communications, for the National League of Cities. Carnegie Hill Neighbors, whose district is slated for six of the new 5G towers, wants a citywide moratorium on installations while an alternative is sought, Cawley said. At the group’s urging, New York Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler asked US officials to assessBloomberg Terminal the towers’ effect on historic districts. The Federal Communications Commission in April called for reviews, slowing deployment. A Carnegie Hill bulletin lists Dimon and Chenault as donors to the neighborhood group but doesn’t disclose who gave to the 5G towers fund specifically (the group offers large tote bags to donors of $5,000 or more.) Representatives for Chenault and Dimon declined to comment. Chenault has signed a letter of support for the tower deployment across the city. US wireless providers began offering 5G to the public in 2019, and the rollout is accelerating. The technology offers ultrafast speeds and high capacity, letting the network connect legions of devices, including baby monitors, vehicles, smart watches, industrial monitors, drones and virtual-reality headsets. The so-called small cell sites that house the 5G transmitters are set to grow by more than 1 million in the US over the next decade, from about 211,000 in 2022, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. All that gear has to go somewhere, fueling tension between localities worried their streets may be marred by industrial dreck, and the companies serving up wireless connections.    “We are going to have to figure out a way to cooperatively work with communities to get this network infrastructure deployed,” Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel told lawmakers in June. “And I don’t want those relationships to be hostile, friction-filled, or aggressive.” The towers have attracted support among those focused on improving service in “internet deserts,” such as the Bronx. “We need partners like LinkNYC who are committed to dismantling systemic barriers to accessing Wi-Fi connectivity,” Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson said in an email. “As more affluent neighborhoods might have stable connectivity and are opposing the kiosks in their communities, it is not the same reality for many of our residents and families in the Bronx.” About 90% of the towers are slated to be installed in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and above 96th Street in Manhattan, spreading the service beyond the richest parts of the city. So far New York has rolled out 107 and 86 have been activated to supply Wi-Fi to nearby users. Six community boards in Manhattan and 10 more in other boroughs have expressed opposition to the towers. Members in the CityBridge group include out-of-home advertising company Intersection, and an infrastructure specialist formerly called ZenFi Networks, now part of Boldyn Networks. It plans to make money from fees charged to 5G wireless providers, and from advertising on video screens attached to some of the smart poles.  “Contrary to the handful of vocal NIMBY groups who support the unequal status quo, we believe our residents and visitors deserve the same connection quality wherever they work, live, or travel throughout the five boroughs,” said Ray Legendre, a spokesperson for the city’s Office of Technology and Innovation.']\n",

The Constitutional Court said on Thursday that the law, which restricts companies’ advertising spending and use of customer data if their sales exceed given thresholds, was in line with the constitution, rejecting an objection by the main opposition party. The ruling should help smaller e-commerce firms to compete after rapid growth of the market since the pandemic. Turkey’s total e-commerce volume rose 109% last year to over 800 billion liras ($30.5 billion), with almost a fifth of all shopping done online, Trade Ministry data show.

The agency discovered in the past months that several companies were using their licenses “as a cover-up in the conduct of illegal activities, including cryptocurrency investment,” Tengco said. “This became a massive blow to the industry.” Online casinos found to be engaged in crime have been penalized, and their permits have been revoked, the official said. Further accreditations were also suspended, while existing operators will be subjected to new fees and stringent monitoring, he added. The Southeast Asian nation has in the past years witnessed an exodus in the once-booming online gambling industry due to the pandemic and efforts to tax operations. Online casinos have also been linked to suspicious transactions and human trafficking, with the country’s finance chief favoring to shutBloomberg Terminal these businesses. Still, the gaming regulator is projecting that its gross gaming revenue from online gaming will surge by more than double to 24 billion pesos ($441 million) by yearend, said Tengco, adding that his agency has accredited service providers for electronic bingo, e-billiards and sports betting.']\n",

      "['Worries around debt repayments and stretched finances in billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Ltd. are once again in focus, underscored by losses in some bonds of the commodity giant.   The London-based company’s Indian unit Vedanta Ltd.’s semiconductor-making ambitions were dealt with a blow this week after its Taiwanese partner Hon Hai Technology Group decided to part ways on the planned $19 billion joint venture, leaving the firm alone to develop a project where it holds little expertise. Vedanta said it remains fully committed to its semiconductor project, raising concerns it will hurt the firm’s cash further and in turn its ability to pay up dividends to its cash-reliant parent.  Vedanta’s outstanding dollar bonds plunged, with notes due in April 2026 falling 6.1 cents this week, the most since five days ended March 24, while securities due in August 2024 declined by the most in about three months. Both the notes have fallen below the 70 cents on the dollar mark this week, a level that is generally considered distressed. The bonds were further rocked after a reportBloomberg Terminal this week said Vedanta Resources is exploring a debt exchange offer, under which it may partly repay some bonds and exchange the remaining with new bonds that have longer repayment timelines. That implies repaying some of the debt early on even as the miner’s next bond principal payment of $1.1 billionBloomberg Terminal is due in January. “A potential debt-exchange offer by Vedanta Resources, as reported by the press, may extend dollar bondholders’ exposure to weaker liquidity, increased debt and higher execution risk at subsidiary Vedanta Ltd.,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mary Ellen Olson and Sheenu Gupta. “Vedanta Ltd.’s execution risks could rise as it targets higher capex and new technology-related investments.” Vedanta Resources has multiple financing lines, and continuously explores and conducts financing and refinancing exercises, the group’s spokesperson said. “As always, Vedanta Resources will inform the market promptly of any material developments for the group.” This week’s bond moves reverse some gains made a few weeks back, when all the outstanding bonds were above the 70 cents mark. Vedanta Resources’ notes still outperform the broader emerging market Asia dollar index this year as the commodity giant has repaid all its obligations timely.  The company slashed its total debt to $6.4 billion as on May-end, from about $16 billion the at end of March 2022. The outlook for Vedanta Resources has improved this financial year helped by a recent $1.3 billion fundraising and other options including dividends, stake pledging, CreditSightsBloomberg Terminal said in a note Wednesday. But, risks still remain. S&P Global InvestorsBloomberg Terminal, that has rated Vedanta Resources’ bonds B-, said last week that the firm’s refinancing risks will rise if it does not lay out a repayment plan at least six months before the actual debt maturity.']\n",

It plans to maintain a high exposure to stocks versus cash for the rest of the year.  The fund’s top holdings as of the end of the first half included electronics supplier Luxshare Precision Industry Co., auto components maker Huizhou Desay Sv Automotive Co., and Will Semiconductor Co. The vehicle also increased its exposure to Iflytek Co. and Suzhou TFC Optical Communication Co. in the three months ended June. Investors are debating if Chinese equities have hit a bottom as signs of further policy support and the end of a crackdown on the tech sector fuel hopes of a recovery. Global fundsBloomberg Terminal bought the most local shares since January on Thursday, in a possible sign that the tide may be turning for the market. The Soochow Mobile fund delivered a 75% return this year, a performance that helped it beat over 2,000 other vehicles, according to East Money Information Co., a fund tracker. In comparison, the CSI 300 Index has climbed less than 1% since end-December. Managers of the Soochow Mobile fund, which oversees the equivalent of $38 million, are of the view that the onshore stock market will enter a “tech era” in the next three to five years. AI and the policy drive for a digital economy will fuel a new growth engine, they said. The fund remains upbeat on semiconductors for the next six months, on expectations that fundamentals will improve. “ChatGPT applications may bring about smarter hardware, and spur a cycle of replacements in consumer devices,” according to the filing.

That compares with an average estimate of 2.6 billion kronor among analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Equipment makers are struggling as the global market for the radio access networks, the gear that handles mobile communications, is expected to stagnate in coming years. The RAN market’s compound growth rate is projected to decline by 1% annually over the next five years, although less developed markets will perform better, according to a Dell’Oro Group forecast published Thursday.  “In Networks, we saw strong execution with record build-out speed in India,” Chief Executive Officer Borje Ekholm said in the statement. “Sales growth in India partly offset the expected softening we saw in other markets, notably in North America, where build-out pace moderated and customer inventory levels were reduced.” Read More: Global Mobile Networks Market Is Forecast to Shrink Through 2027Bloomberg Terminal Net sales grew by 3% to 64.4 billion kronor, while Ericsson posted a net loss of 600 million kronor, primarily due to restructuring charges.  The company said it expects third-quarter Ebita margin will be in line with or slightly higher than last quarter, and it maintained its target of reaching the low end of its 15-18% target in 2024. The early impact of Ericsson’s 11 billion-kronor cost-cutting plan announced in February will be seen in the current period, according to the statement.  Inventory corrections at US carriers remained a factor in the period, according to Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander.  “They are continuing to reduce their inventory and therefore buying less equipment from us, but it is flattening out,” Mellander said in an interview.

The FTC wants the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn a lower-court judge’s July 10 order that cleared the companies to proceed toward their July 18 closure deadline. “Consummation of the proposed deal would irreversibly alter the status quo and, if done before the merits of the FTC’s appeal are heard, would irreparably harm the FTC’s ability to order effective relief for the public should the deal prove to be in violation of the antitrust laws,” FTC lawyers wrote in the filing Thursday. US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley earlier Thursday rejected the FTC’s request that she extend a pause on the deal while the appeal proceeds. Barring action by the appeals court, Microsoft and Activision can complete the deal as of 11:59 p.m. in San Francisco on July 14.  The FTC isn’t backing down in the antitrust fight that represents a major test of its ability to block big tech deals in court after the agency lost a challenge to an acquisition by Meta Platforms Inc. earlier this year.  FTC Chair Lina Khan defended the agency’s decision to appeal the ruling earlier Thursday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.

      "['Asia’s earnings season kicks off this week, with tech companies in the limelight after a few early disappointments and an escalating chip war between the US and China.  Chip bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Indian software services firm Infosys Ltd. are set to announce results. The global tech industry downturn has deepened as online activity waned after the pandemic and recession fears hammered consumer sentiment. Samsung Electronics Co. reported its worst decline in quarterly revenue since at least 2009. China’s decision to control exports of two key metals used in chips has exacerbated uncertainty in the industry. The curbs may prompt the US and European countries to tighten tech exports to China and affect the profitability of major tech firms, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Marvin Lo and Chris Muckensturm.  “The escalating chip war could be a swing factor of the current tech-market recovery,” they said.  China stepped up support for the ailing real estate sector and extended policies to support cash-strapped developers. Debt-laden developer China Evergrande Group is expected to report long-awaited 2021 and 2022 annual results Monday. India’s largest producer JSW Steel Ltd. will announce first-quarter results on Friday. The firm is considering a bid for as much as a 20% stake in Teck Resources Ltd.’s steelmaking coal business, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Potential financing for the acquisition may total about $2 billion.  Highlights to look out for: Monday: Evergrande (3333 HK) will approve 2021 and 2022 annual results, as well as interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The crisis-hit group is working with offshore bondholders to finalize its offshore debt restructuring proposalBloomberg Terminal and expects to apply in late July to courts in the relevant jurisdictions to move ahead with the plan. Its onshore unit’s overdue commercial bills of about 245 billion yuan ($34.2 billion) also threaten to delay completion of its pre-sold projects, putting China’s housing sentiment recovery at risk, BI analysts Kristy Hung and Lisa Zhou saidBloomberg Terminal. It may be delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange if it fails to file audited results by September, they added. Tuesday: No major earnings expected. Wednesday: No major earnings expected. Thursday: TSMC (2330 TT) is expected to exceed second-quarter earnings estimates. While a surge of AI chip orders from Nvidia and other foundry customers should give an upbeat forecast, the earnings trajectory in the second half may still be dragged down by a sluggish smartphone sector, BI analyst Charles Shum saidBloomberg Terminal. Its capacity expansion plan, a response to increasing demand from Nvidia and other major chip designers, will be in focus, he addedBloomberg Terminal. The firm earlier reported June sales of NT$156.4 billion ($5 billion), a year-on-year drop of 11%. Second-quarter revenue totaled NT$480.8 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations, a 10% decline on the prior year but better than analysts expected. Friday: JSW Steel (JSTL IN) may say first-quarter adjusted profit rose, led by higher domestic sales volume as the Indian economy gathered pace. Crude steel output at India’s biggest steel producer rose 11% in the quarter and analysts predict similar growth in sales volume. The scrapping of steel export duties in November may also boost exports. The company has also forecast sequentially higher coking coal costs, which may affect profit margins.']\n",

      "['India launched an uncrewed mission to the lunar surface, joining the US, China and others in a new moon race. The Chandrayaan-3 blasted off at 2:35 p.m. local time Friday from India’s main spaceport on Sriharikota, an island off the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, as a crowd of visitors watched. It will spend about six weeks in space before attempting to touch down close to the lunar south pole, near where the nation’s previous moon mission ended in a crash in 2019.  If successful, the rover will conduct experiments on the chemical makeup of the moon’s surface and search for water. The rover will have a life span of one lunar day, which is equivalent to 14 days on Earth.  Only the Soviet Union, China and the US have made successful moon landings, and only NASA has sent astronauts there. India launched its first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, in 2008. The mission highlights Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus on bolstering India’s place among the world’s space faring nations. His administration began liberalizing the space sector in 2020, allowing private companies to participate actively. The US aims to send humans back to the moon before the end of the decade, using landers developed by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and China has plans for its first crewed lunar mission by 2030. Russia, which hasn’t landed on the moon since the end of the Soviet Union, will attempt to send a robotic mission next month. Japan has an uncrewed mission planned for August, too. India’s new mission comes as the country has made a breakthrough in boosting cooperation with the US in outer space. The country is also in discussions with Japan to work on a moon mission together, ISRO Chairman S Somanath told reporters in New Delhi on Monday. During Modi’s state visit to Washington last month, India signed the Artemis Accords, a US-backed framework with more than two-dozen other nations — but not China or Russia — governing joint missions and civilian space exploration. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to a joint mission next year that will include sending an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station. India’s space infrastructure includes 25 Earth observation satellites and about 30 other satellites, Somanath wrote in an article in the May issue of Yojana. That puts India well behind China, which had 590 operating satellites at the end of 2022, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. While Chinese rockets have carried more than two dozen people into space since China’s first astronaut, Yang Liwei, went to orbit in 2003, it’s been nearly 40 years since the only Indian to go into outer space, Rakesh Sharma, traveled aboard a Soviet rocket to the USSR’s space station. ISRO has not yet set a date for the initial flight of its human spaceflight program, called Gaganyaan, but in his article Somanath described the project as “at an advanced stage.” By signing the Artemis Accords and getting NASA to agree to send an Indian astronaut to the ISS, Modi may reap political benefits as he prepares to ask voters next year to extend his premiership into a second decade, said Konark Bhandari, an associate fellow at Carnegie India, a New Delhi-based affiliate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It would be impressive to have an astronaut of your own in space before the elections,” he said.']\n",

      "['Microsoft Corp. and Activision Blizzard Inc. are considering giving up some control of their cloud-gaming business in the UK as a way to appease regulators so they can complete their $69 billion merger by the July 18 deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. That could involve selling off the cloud-based market rights for games in the UK to a telecommunications, gaming or internet-based computing company, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential planning. A private equity company might also be interested, said one person.  Both companies still think it’s possible to close the deal, which would be the largest ever in the video-game industry, before next week’s deadline, the people said. Regulators in the US and UK have come out against the deal, which would combine one of the biggest video game publishers with one of the largest console makers into an industry behemoth.  It’s currently unclear just how Microsoft will legally be able to close the deal by Tuesday without breaching UK laws and incurring large fines from the Competition and Markets Authority. While the CMA said Tuesday it’s prepared to evaluate proposals from Microsoft, the agency also said the companies would need to resubmit their transaction for the normally multi-month regulatory process to begin anew.  But there are options available, according to Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and ex-CMA legal director.  “It’s all quite debatable, but I believe the most likely route to allowing the deal to close by Tuesday is for the CMA to issue a derogation from its interim order,” said Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and ex-CMA legal director, referring to the formal notice the deals watchdog issued in May ordering the companies to remain separate pending a final decision. “They could allow the deal to close but require the Activision Blizzard business to be held separate pending the final order,” he said. “The CMA would look reasonable while preserving their position.” Spokespeople for Microsoft and Activision declined to comment. The CMA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the process. The US Federal Trade Commission on Thursday asked a California court to pause the deal while the agency’s challenge is pending. The FTC wants the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn a lower-court judge’s July 10 order that cleared the companies to proceed toward their July 18 closure deadline. The deal is seen as a major test of the FTC’s ability to block big-tech deals. Read More: FTC Asks Appeals Court to Pause Microsoft-Activision Deal  US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley earlier rejected the FTC’s request to extend a pause on the deal while the agency appeals her ruling greenlighting the transaction. Barring action by the appeals court, Microsoft and Activision can complete the deal as of 11:59 p.m. in San Francisco on July 14. In its earlier findings, the UK regulator had expressed concerns that adding Activision content to Microsoft’s xCloud service would restrict competition in the nascent market for video games that are streamed over the internet rather than downloaded to consoles or devices. Microsoft offers xCloud as part of a monthly gaming subscription. The CMA has said it strongly prefers structural remedies like a divestiture to behavioral ones, under which the agency must monitor whether a company complies with its promises. Meanwhile, in a procedural move, separate from this week’s developments, the CMA said Friday it had extended its deadline for issuing a legally final order on the deal until Aug. 29. It said this was to consider a previous “detailed and complex submission from Microsoft claiming that there are material changes in circumstance and special reasons” meaning the CMA shouldn’t press ahead with its veto. CNBC reported earlier that Microsoft had offered a small divestiture to regulators, without specifying what might be sold. The Hurdles That Remain for Microsoft-Activision Deal: QuickTake']\n",

      "['A group of Twitter Inc.’s former top executives say the struggling social-media platform owes them more than $1.6 million for legal fees and they want a judge to force new owner Elon Musk to pay that tab now.  The group – led by ex-Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal – says the legal bills accrued in connection with lawsuits and government probes of the company’s activities while they ran it. The former executives claim Twitter is violating its own bylaws by refusing to cover the sums. They were ousted when Musk bought the company for $44 billion last year.  “Over the better part of the past year, plaintiffs have tried and failed to make Twitter honor its advancement obligations,” their lawyers said Wednesday in a court filing. “Twitter invented evolving excuses for its non-payment of the full amounts owed.” Agrawal, along with former chief counsel Vijaya Gadde and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, are asking Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick to order Twitter to cover the expenses without holding a trial.  Twitter faces numerous suits alleging that the company under Musk’s leadership has failed to pay millions owed to former employees, vendors and landlords while purportedly trying to stay financially solvent. Read More: Twitter Is Letting Bills Pile Up, and Lawsuits Are Coming, Too Musk’s X Corp. this month sued the law firm that led the court fight to make him complete his takeover of Twitter, saying it took advantage of the company while running up a $90 millionBloomberg Terminal bill. The suit put some of the blame on “lame duck” executives at the social media platform, including Gadde, who Musk says went on a legal “spending spree” before he took control. Twitter didn’t specifically respond to a request for comment on the legal-fee dispute. Delaware law generally favors advancement of legal fees on behalf of current and former executives of companies who are sued over their duties as officers or directors of the firms. The company has paid about $600,000 of what it owes, but has withheld $1,158,427 in fees for lawyers’ work representing former top managers in a congressional inquiry into the influence of social media on US elections, which required Gadde to appear before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, according to the filing. The company also has failed to reimburse the group for $273,747 in fees tied with investigations by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission into Twitter’s practices, along with civil lawsuits, according to the filing. Musk also is refusing to cover $237,261 in fees generated by efforts to get them to cover the other legal bills. Twitter also is facing several investor suits over the fallout from Musk’s purchase of the platform after his failed effort to scuttle the deal. Former employees have sued, too, claiming they were wrongfully denied promised stock grants after being laid off. The case is Agrawal v. Twitter Inc., 2023-0409, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).']\n",

      "['When you arrive at Bank of America’s new-employee boot camp at the New York Hilton Midtown, you’ll find a VR headset waiting for you. Slide it on, and you’ll be confronted with an angry customer, frustrated over a mix-up with their account. Your task: talk them down and make them feel heard. Or you can practice keeping your cool while responding to a robbery, and then unwind by relaxing on a virtual island or by sitting on a unicorn.  Bank of America Corp. uses artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the metaverse as part of an immersive training program for its 2,000 new hires. The move reflects a larger shift in the banking sector, as firms develop technology to enhance performance and cut down costs.  “These simulations act like practice reps. It makes a new employee experienced, even if they’re brand new,” John Jordan, head of the Academy at Bank of America, said in an interview.   Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in April that AI could have “extreme benefits” and would help to reduce headcount. But he also urged caution. “We have to understand how the decisions are made” as AI becomes more advanced, he saidBloomberg Terminal. Read More: JPMorgan’s AI Push Has Wall Street Rivals Playing Catch-Up At the week-long training, Bank of America executives deliver keynotes and host panels on subjects like “diversity and inclusion” and “responsible growth,” the firm’s motto. But on their breaks, new hires are encouraged to visit the conference rooms stocked with dozens of VR headsets. Using the technology, employees see a 360-degree view of a bank branch. There, they can learn by doing, not just listening — they even get virtual credit for doing so. Additional modules walk employees through the bank’s history and explain their benefits packages. Another module offers “wellness” experiences, including that mystical unicorn.  Mike Wynn, innovation and design executive for Bank of America’s Academy, said the virtual trainings offer real-world scenarios, such as a customer asking for large sums of money or complaining about a fraudulent account. Employees can also engage in an AI-based conversation with a bot acting as a Bank of America client, and another bot coaching them through the proper responses.  This immersive experience isn’t just for new hires: Bank of America has been using it for more than 200,000 staffers around the world. Every one of its call centers has an AI coach to help rehearse conversations with customers. A manager having a tough time getting through to an employee can set them up with an AI bot for further training.   Wynn said AI and metaverse trainings offer unique advantages. “It’s hard to teach traditionally. VR creates anxiety, it gets your heart rate up. It makes you nervous.”  When Bank of America first piloted its VR program in 2019, 97% of the participants felt more comfortable performing their tasks after going through the simulations. Bank of America found that employees absorbed training material faster than they did in traditional classroom settings. But technology has its limits, Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who researches the impacts of disruptive technologies on business and society, told Bloomberg News. “Even if a machine could provide insight into emotional questions, I as a trainee might still prefer a human trainer,” he said. Wynn said this new technology is “not about removing the human connection. It’s about making the human connection stronger, simulating reality.” Bank of America is also weighing using the metaverse to tap a younger generation of potential hires at career fairs. “Instead of telling them about the experience in banking, we show them that day what it’s like to live the life of an associate,” Jordan said.']\n",

US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley issued a two-sentence order late Thursday rejecting the FTC’s latest effort to block the mega gaming deal. The FTC is appealing Corley’s July 10 decision to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The agency also said Thursday it will seek emergency action by the 9th Circuit to stop the deal from closing. Barring court action, Microsoft and Activision can complete the deal as of 11:59 p.m. in San Francisco on July 14. Microsoft and Activision had asked Corley to deny the FTC’s request for an injunction, arguing that she’d previously ruled it would be “inequitable” to block the deal in a way that would result in “the potential scuttling of the merger.” Corley found that the blockbuster game deal won’t thwart competition in the markets for console, subscription and cloud gaming and harm consumers. She denied the agency’s request for a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the deal from closing.

      "['A Stability AI Ltd. co-founder has sued the company, claiming he was tricked into selling his stake for $100 months before the British artificial intelligence startup hit a $1 billion valuation.  Cyrus Hodes said he sold his 15% stake in Stability AI to another co-founder, Emad Mostaque, in two transactions in October 2021 and May 2022, according to a federal lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco. Hodes alleges that Mostaque had led him to believe the company was “essentially worthless.”  By August 2022, Stability AI had unveiled Stable Diffusion, an image creation tool, and announced $101 million in venture capital funding, vaulting the startup to the forefront of the red-hot generative AI sector, according to the suit. Hodes accused Mostaque, who’s also the company’s chief executive officer, of violating fiduciary duties.  “In an act of self-dealing by a faithless fiduciary, Mostaque brazenly deceived Hodes about the core business of Stability AI that Mostaque was developing, its likely valuation, and its fundraising,” according to the lawsuit. In a statement, Stability AI said, “The suit is without merit and we will aggressively defend our position.” Mostaque, a former hedge fund employee, registered Stability AI in the UK in 2019. He and Hodes, a former adviser to the United Arab Emirates and previous AI program director at Harvard University, first began working on a project in early 2020 called Collective and Augmented Intelligence Against Covid-19, or CAIAC, meant to provide public agencies with useful data on the pandemic. Over the next year, Hodes spent more than $15,000 of his own money to cover company expenses, according to the lawsuit.  Read More: Stability AI Secures Convertible Note After Fundraising Struggle Stability AI missed the deadline for the CAIAC project. In the suit, Hodes alleged that this was because Mostaque was “secretly diverting” resources to work on a text-to-image generator — the product that eventually became Stable Diffusion. Mostaque has previously blamed insufficient funding for failing to meet the project’s goals. Hodes is the second Stability AI co-founder to claim he wasn’t fairly compensated in a lawsuit.  In May, Tayab Waseem, a medical doctor who said he served as Stability AI’s Chief Scientific Officer in 2020 on the CAIAC project, sued the company and Mostaque. Waseem claimed he was promised a stake in Stability AI, only to be told his work was on a volunteer basis after the company raised its $101 million round. However, Waseem withdrew the suit the same day he filed it. Getty Images Inc. has also sued Stability AI in a London court in January, arguing that Stable Diffusion had illegally relied on copyrighted images to train its data. The company has denied the charges.

      "['The US Justice Department’s case against Alex Mashinsky, the former chief executive officer of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network Ltd., paints a picture of a man who went to great lengths to dupe investors about the value of his once-high-flying business. In an indictment unsealed Thursday in Manhattan, prosecutors claim that from 2018 through June 2022 Mashinsky orchestrated a wide-ranging scheme to mislead Celsius customers about “core aspects” of the company’s business and inflate the value of its proprietary token, CEL. The alleged scheme was previewed in an earlier civil suit by New York’s attorney general, but the Justice Department case puts the claims in sharper focus. Mashinsky’s lawyer, Jonathan Ohring, said in a statement that “Alex vehemently denies the allegations” and called the charges “baseless.” The US charges boil down to an old deception with a fresh crypto angle: Mashinsky portrayed Celsius as a modern-day bank, where customers could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest. In truth, however, Mashinsky operated Celsius as a risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretenses and turning customers into unwitting investors in a business far riskier and less profitable than what Mashinsky had represented.  Calling Celsius the “safest place for your crypto,” Mashinsky urged the public to “unbank” themselves by moving their assets to Celsius. Customers were enticed with returns on their crypto assets in the form of weekly “rewards,” and the ability to take loans secured by their deposits. But the promises were never what they seemed, prosecutors say.   Mashinsky repeatedly made public misrepresentations regarding core aspects of Celsius’s business and financial condition in order to induce retail customers to provide their crypto assets to Celsius and continue to use Celsius’s services. Mashinsky misrepresented, among other things, the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, Celsius’s profitability, the long-term sustainability of Celsius’s high-reward rates, and the risks of associated with depositing crypto assets with Celsius. Mashinsky’s habit of speaking directly to customers and potential customers via live-streamed “Ask Mashinsky Anything” broadcasts featured heavily in the indictment. The sessions, posted to Celsius’s YouTube page, included so many false and misleading statements that Celsius employees regularly had them edited out before they went online, prosecutors say. But, despite warnings from other Celsius employees, Mashinsky continued to misrepresent the nature of Celsius’s core business activities in live broadcasts. Moreover, neither Mashinsky nor Celsius ever issued corrections to notify the public and those who had watched the live recorded versions of the AMAs that certain of Mashinsky’s statements were untrue or misleading. The indictment outlines a second scheme that focused on alleged efforts to manipulate the price of CEL in a way that caused the public to buy into the token at inflated prices. It started when Mashinsky allegedly lied to customers about the outcome of Celsius’s 2018 “initial coin offering” for CEL by claiming he’d raised $50 million by selling all the tokens he had made available. In reality, Celsius failed to sell more than one-third of the 325 million CEL tokens it had made available for sale and only raised approximately $32 million through the ICO. The alleged deception kicked off a years-long scheme to “mislead customers and market participants” about the value of CEL, allowing Mashinsky to sell his own tokens at inflated values, according to the indictment. The CEO and others manipulated the true worth of CEL by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy CEL in the open market to inflate the price, the US says. Mashinsky, the defendant, repeatedly made false and misleading public statements concerning the nature of Celsius’s market activity and the extent to which Celsius itself was responsible for artificially supporting and inflating the price of CEL, thus making it appear that there was a broader market interest in CEL than actually existed. Celsius’s false and misleading statements couldn’t protect the company when the crypto industry was in crisis. But that didn’t stop Mashinsky from allegedly telling customers that everything was fine, according to the indictment. Mashinsky, the defendant, nevertheless continued to publicly tout the safety of Celsius and encourage customers to continue to deposit crypto on the Celsius platform, even as Mashinsky himself withdrew almost all his non-CEL personal crypto deposits, worth millions of dollars, from the Celsius platform. On June 12, 2022, Celsius announced that it was halting all customer withdrawals. At the time, hundreds of thousands of investors had about $4.7 billion worth of crypto assets on the Celsius platform, “none of which they could access,” according to the indictment. Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the next day. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, which also sued, highlighted efforts by Celsius and Mashinsky to hide its financial condition in the spring of 2022, even as its crypto assets sharply declined in value. On May 11, 2022, Celsius said on Twitter that it “abides by robust risk management frameworks” and that “all user funds are safe,” according to the suit. But in reality, Celsius was “in dire financial shape” and executives were communicating about “significant financial losses” at the time, the SEC claims. Nine days before the tweet, Mashinsky and board members discussed the company’s “significant financial losses and struggling business model.” A presentation noted pre-tax losses of $811 million for 2021 and $165 million in losses for the first quarter of 2021. On May 9, a Celsius executive called the company “a sinking ship,” the SEC said. Within days, that executive wrote “there is no hope…there is no plan,” and the business model is “fundamentally broken.” Celsius allegedly deepend its deception by encouraging customers to ignore the warning signs, the SEC said. In a June 7 blog post entitled “Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead,” the company said it was “deeply optimistic about the future,” despite “misinformation and confusion.” At the same time, a business outlook presentation had been circulating that said: “Celsius has been consistently losing money and is facing an erosion in the capital position as well as liquidity constraints. The current business model is not financially sustainable.” By 2021, Celsius’s reward obligations to customers exceeded net revenue by about $1 billion and by $380 million in the first half of 2022, the CFTC said in its complaint. The company “used customer assets to fund operational expenses and rewards, failed to adequately track or reconcile customer assets and liabilities on a digital asset by digital asset basis,” and didn’t “recognize a significant shortfall in customer deposited digital asset commodities.”']\n",

      "['When top anime streaming platform Crunchyroll was first gaining popularity as a pirated-video site in the mid-2000s, Japanese animation was considered a niche form of entertainment, appealing mainly to enthusiasts known as otaku. Today, it’s a $20 billion industry spanning streaming, games and merchandise, and the company’s hit series, such as One Piece and Demon Slayer, have drawn millions of US and European subscribers. Crunchyroll, now owned by Sony Group Corp., is setting its sights on India as a major growth market — one that could help the industry further expand from a made-in-Japan subculture into a mainstream and global phenomenon.  The company, founded in 2006 by graduates of the University of California at Berkeley, started off as an anime-sharing site. It eventually began streaming only legitimate content, helped by investment from venture capitalists including former News Corp. President Peter Chernin and ownership by AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia. Now the largest anime-dedicated streaming platform in the world, it was bought by Sony in a $1.2 billion deal announced in 2020.  Crunchyroll has more than 100 million registered members, including 11 million paid users, after rapid subscriber growth during the pandemic when people binge-watched exotic content. With growth in Western markets moderating, the anime giant is looking to India for its next breakthrough, according to President Rahul Purini.  “In terms of percentage growth, India will be a significant driver of our growth,” Purini said in an interview ahead of a business trip next week to Mumbai, where he plans to meet potential partners. “They’re small numbers right now, but we believe they will become a significant portion of our subscriber base.” Crunchyroll is seeing more anime fans in new markets such as South America and Southeast Asia. Expansion in India, with its burgeoning youth population, could prove particularly helpful in turbocharging Sony’s efforts to boost its entertainment content business.  In May, Sony Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida shared the company’s long-term vision of increasing users of content, including music, games and movies, by over sixfold to 1 billion people. India is seen as a crucial battleground in that effort, particularly as China remains closed. US streaming services such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. are also competing for a bigger audience in India, where the media and entertainment industry is expected to grow by around 10% annually to $60 billion in 2030.  In India, Sony is also closing in on a mergerBloomberg Terminal with local TV and film business Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., a deal that would create a $10 billion media giant.  Sony bought Crunchyroll through affiliate Funimation, a US home-video distributor also running an anime streaming platform. The integration of the two companies during the pandemic was “the biggest challenge” but is well underway, according to Purini, a Funimation veteran. The migration of content and subscribers from Funimation to Crunchyroll is likely to be completed fairly soon, he said.  Read More: Sony Pictures Acquisitions Could Bolster Long-Term ProfitabilityBloomberg Terminal Crunchyroll’s strategy for India is to acquire more content and to localize anime series using dubbing and subtitles in local languages such as Hindi. The streaming platform recently lowered its prices in the region, which at around $1 a month is roughly a 10th of the price for a comparable, middle-tier plan in the US.  Ironically, the biggest challenge for Crunchyroll is its fight against illegal streaming websites, which are rampant in India. Crunchyroll believes its competitive pricing and unique features will eventually persuade users to opt for paid services.  “If we do our job right, we can convince fans to switch over to an official site,” Purini said. “The other part is that we work in collaboration with our partners, whether it’d be Sony Pictures, whether it’d be our Japanese partners, using all the lawful means at our disposal to be able to talk to fans and address the anti-piracy issue.” Crunchyroll expects the anime industry will have more than 800 million fans globally by 2025 outside markets in China and Japan. Of those, around 200 million are expected to watch series on official websites, he said. The business is open to acquiring assets to grow in targeted markets, he added. Sony doesn’t reveal financial details for Crunchyroll, and Purini declined to share detailed sales or profit numbers. Analysts have said that while anime is still a small part of Sony’s chips-to-movies business empire, it’s emerging as a key growth area.  Goldman Sachs upgraded its recommendation on Sony to a “buy” on Thursday, citing expectations for Crunchyroll. Analyst Minami Munakata estimates that in five years, the anime site will account for 36% of all profit at Sony’s picture’s segment, which includes its Hollywood studio and content business, up from just 1% in the year ended in March. “Given that Crunchyroll is being rolled out in more areas and that demand for dedicated anime streaming services is likely to increase in regions other than North America as the growth of Japanese anime continues overseas, we expect the number of Crunchyroll paid subscribers will increase in the next five years, with regions other than North America becoming the main drivers,” she said in a note.  Technology research firm Omdia also predicted increased global anime viewership, both in theaters and on streaming services. “Japanese anime is worth more outside of Japan than inside now, and this growth will continue,” Omdia senior analyst James McWhirter said, noting strong box office results for titles such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. He noted that some anime is now being produced outside Japan, including in the US and China. “Local anime is also challenging Japanese anime, but also supporting the overall growth of the market,” McWhirter said. “The pie will get bigger.” The biggest competitor to Crunchyroll right now is Netflix, which is also betting big on growing anime fandom. Anime is a popular category among Netflix users in Japan, while Crunchyroll isn’t offering its streaming service in Japan to avoid competing with its local partners. More than half of Netflix’s global subscribers outside Japan watched at least one anime title in 2021, and time spent watching anime has been increasing, according to the company. Purini said he welcomed competition from Netflix as well as Amazon and Walt Disney Co., as their investments could help grow anime’s overall audience. The new fans, he said, could later turn to Crunchyroll to explore the category more deeply.   The company also remains dedicated to its so-called flywheel strategy of offering fans a broad range of services from streaming and theatrical releases to anime-related merchandise. In addition to its expansion in India, he said, Crunchyroll is also discussing the use of new technologies such as AR and VR in partnerships with big tech companies.  “We want to be everything for someone rather than something for everyone,” Purini said.']\n",

      "['The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into OpenAI Inc., questioning whether its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot puts consumers’ reputations and data at risk, according to a person familiar with the matter. The probe into the Microsoft Corp.-backed startup marks the first official inquiry into a technology that has the potential to change almost every aspect of people’s lives and has become almost equally fascinating for its potential to run awry. FTC Chair Lina Khan, who testified before Congress Thursday, has raised concerns about AI before, saying enforcers “need to be vigilant early” with transformative tools like artificial intelligence.  Microsoft declined to comment. In a series of tweets Thursday, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said “of course we will work with the FTC,” and that it is “super important” to the company that its technology is “safe and pro-consumer.” Altman also said OpenAI is “confident” it’s adhering to US laws. “We protect user privacy and design our systems to learn about the world, not private individuals,” he said. The Washington Post earlier reported on the FTC’s probe. The FTC’s investigation opens a potent regulatory salvo at San Francisco-based OpenAI, the leader in generative AI technology whose ChatGPT app has sparked a race among companies across nearly every industry to develop their own competing chatbots. ChatGPT is built atop a large language model, which is trained on enormous swaths of text from the internet so that it can generate responses to questions in a way that sounds human-like. The probe “is a significant development that could have implications for both the company and the broader AI innovation sector,” said Divyansh Kaushik, associate director for emerging technologies and national security at the Federation of American Scientists, a non-partisan think tank in Washington. “It signals that regulators are becoming more proactive in ensuring that AI companies operate ethically and responsibly.” The rapid rise of the technology in the past eight months since ChatGPT become widely available, has prompted calls for regulation and a pause in training of advanced AI systems, even among the heads of some of the leading companies in the field, such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Alphabet Inc.’s DeepMind.  Altman has been an outspoken proponent of regulation. In a May hearing, Altman said Congress should create robust safety standards for advanced AI systems. “If this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,” Altman said. Twitter owner Elon Musk has also been one of the loudest voices warning about the potential consequences of mainstreaming AI.  Read more: Humans Are Biased. Generative AI Is Even Worse A prominent tech ethics group filed a complaint in March urging the FTC to halt further commercial deployment of the technology that powers ChatGPT. The complaint from the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy, which is led by longtime privacy advocate Marc Rotenberg, called on the FTC to open the investigation and “ensure the establishment of necessary guardrails to protect consumers, businesses, and the commercial marketplace.” The FTC, which enforces both antitrust and consumer protection laws, is also taking a close look at how competition is developing in the space, Khan has said, to ensure dominant firms aren’t using their power over key inputs like data to discriminate against rivals. The agency is also monitoring how AI tools are being used by scammers and will enforce the law, not just against fraudsters, but also against companies that enable them, she said. In a 20-page letter addressed to OpenAI this week, the FTC asked the company to provide detailed descriptions of all complaints it had received of its products making “false, misleading, disparaging or harmful” statements about people, according to the Washington Post. The FTC is looking into whether the company engaged in unfair or deceptive practices that caused “reputational harm” to consumers, according to the Post. The FTC also asked the company to provide records related to a security incident that the company disclosed in March when a bug in its systems allowed some users to see payment-related information, as well as some data from other users’ chat history.  Khan faced a grilling in Congress on Thursday in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, where Republican lawmakers attacked her adherence to ethics laws and aggressive antitrust enforcement, labeled her “bully” and told her leadership was “a disaster.”']\n",

      "['US shoppers spent $12.7 billion online during Amazon.com Inc.’s 48-hour Prime Day, up 6.1% from a year ago but short of estimates for 9.5% growth, according to Adobe Inc. An increasing share of customers used “buy now, pay later” services, Adobe said, indicating shoppers are concerned about the economy.  “For months, consumers have felt the effects of persistent inflation and an uncertain economic environment, and it has pushed shoppers to embrace more flexible ways to manage their spending around the Prime Day event,” said Vivek Pandya, an analyst with the technology company. “The revenue growth attributed to buy now, pay later is a preview of what we can expect in the months ahead, especially as we near the holiday shopping season.”  Adobe measures total spending on US online shopping sites during the Prime Day period because a host of retailers, including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., draft off Amazon’s marquee summer sale, offering their own discounts and boosting overall e-commerce sales at a time of year when shoppers typically pull back.  Amazon shares rose almost 3% in New York, part of a broader rally.  Numerator, which tracked purchases by more than 34,000 unique buyers on Amazon, said the average order size during the event was $54.05, up about 3% from a year earlier. More than half of Prime Day shoppers surveyed by the data provider say they compared Amazon’s prices with those at other retailers before making their purchases. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in an interview with CNBC last week that price-conscious shoppers were “trading down whenever they can” given the uncertain economy.  “In an event typically dominated by electronics, we instead saw many shoppers stocking up on everyday essentials like pet food or pantry staples,” Numerator analyst Amanda Schoenbauer said in a statement. “It seems many used the event to save on their standard purchases or held off on buying larger ticket items until the sale came around.” Insider Intelligence expected shoppers worldwide to spend an estimated $12.9 billion on Amazon during the event, up about 11% from last year. Amazon doesn’t break out the financial metrics of its biggest sale, instead releasing mostly anecdotal information about top sellers. The company on Thursday said the first day of the sale was the biggest in its history and that shoppers purchased more than 375 million items over two days. Amazon launched Prime Day in 2015 to attract new subscribers, who pay $139 a year for shipping discounts, video streaming and other benefits. The event helps Amazon lock in shoppers before the holidays and deepen its relationship with existing customers by offering them exclusive deals on Amazon gadgets and other products. About 167 million Amazon shoppers in the US had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The sale was also expected to fuel Amazon’s advertising business, which provides the independent merchants who account for most of the sales on Amazon’s website with real-time insights and helps them target their spending more effectively. Advertising last year generated $37 billion in sales, or 7.3% of total revenue.  In an effort to counter buyer disappointment when some of the best deals disappear within seconds, Amazon this year launched “invite-only” promotions that let shoppers register interest in a deal and receive a unique link to purchase items that are still available.  The promotion adds a kind of lottery effect to some Prime Day bargains and saves Amazon shoppers the hassle of constantly monitoring the site and refreshing their browsers, said Kristin McGrath, editor of RetailMeNot, which monitors online deals. “This way you either get the deal or you don’t, and you don’t waste two days searching for it,” she said.

      "[\"Walking into the Mattel Design Center, I felt like a kid taking a Willy Wonka-style trip through my childhood toy box.  Barbie.  He-Man.   Rock ’Em Sock ’Em. This place has it all, showcasing nearly 80 years of toy history that maps a fascinating journey of play and pop culture. On one end, there’s a giant Hot Wheels Track. On the other, there are rows and rows of old Barbie doll heads (and a few of Ken’s, too), where designers invent new hairstyles, sculpt new bodies and paint new faces with the most delicate of brushes. Ahead of Barbie’s big screen debut, produced by Mattel Inc. and Warner Bros Discovery Inc., I wanted to learn more about how her makers are inventing her next act. The movie marks a big bet by Mattel, which hopes to turn legacy brands into blockbuster franchises, and it was reportedly in development well before the company settled on director  Greta Gerwig’s interpretation. Early reviews of the movie, which premieres July 21, are positive. Time calls it a “fun, yet self-aware romp,” while Variety’s social media editor praised it as “perfection.” Expectations are high. Barbie is the most popular doll of all time, after all. She’s an icon, a cultural lightning rod, and an 11.5 inch piece of plastic who has represented and projected our biggest aspirations and flaws since she was created in 1959. In this episode of “The Circuit,” I sat down with   Mattel Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Ynon Kreiz, the leader of the company’s new IP-to-content strategy, and Robbie Brenner, an Oscar-nominated producer whom Kreiz convinced to head Mattel’s burgeoning films division. Their goal is to re-ignite the conversation around a massive but controversial brand that has struggled in recent years, and potentially cement Mattel’s place as a future Hollywood hitmaker. (Think Marvel, if they’re lucky.) “That was a lot to live up to,” Brenner told me. Barbie “is an open-ended conversation. Like, what is that movie?...Greta had sort of this idea of a high heel and a Birkenstock. And that was sort of her leaping off point of what this movie should be. And I thought, God, that's kind of brilliant.” But will it be brilliant enough to reinvigorate sales? We spoke with Barbie’s product designers, a seamstress and a face painter, as well as veteran Mattel executive  Lisa McKnight, who has helped evolve the brand to address popular opinion. “The biggest flag that we heard, and when we did some research, was moms in particular didn't feel good about giving Barbie as a birthday gift,” McKnight said. “They didn't see her as a role model. They saw her as too perfect.”  My favorite part of the episode, by far, is meeting  Richard Dickson, Mattel president and chief operating officer, who took me on a whimsical toy-filled tour starting with the founding of the toymaker itself. It sounds remarkably like a typical Silicon Valley tale. There’s a garage, a couple of men, and a woman  — who gets written out of the story. But this modern-day imagination factory is trying mightily to correct the oversights of its past.  This episode of     The Circuit With Emily Chang   premieres Thursday, July 13, at 8 p.m. in New York on the Bloomberg app and Bloomberg.com and on Bloomberg Television at 10 p.m. Check out     The Circuit podcast   for extended conversations.\"]\n",

      "['Viasat Inc. slumped a record 28% Thursday after announcing an unexpected event that threatened the performance of a key communication satellite.  The impacted satellite, the ViaSat-3 Americas, was launched April 30 on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket and is part of the company’s plans to bolster its North American broadband business. Viasat is working to resolve the problem and there has been no impact to coverage or disruption to customers, according to a statementBloomberg Terminal. The company did not respond to Bloomberg’s request for additional comment.  “This issue could be a major blow to the timing of the Viasat growth story, as Viasat-2 (VS-2) has been capacity constrained in the Americas for many quarters, and the company has been counting on VS-3A to expand capacity in the Americas and resume fixed broadband subscriber growth,” Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note.  Delta Air Lines, Inc. said the hiccup hasn’t lead to any meaningful impact on Wi-Fi on domestic flights, but could potentially delay the availability of international free Wi-Fi.  “If anything, it may cause a delayed rollout on some international markets, but it’s too early to tell,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive officer on a Thursday earnings call with analysts and reporters. While the setback is frustrating for the Carlsbad, California-based company, the stock fallout may be an overreaction, according to William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma.  “This stock selloff is largely driven by emotion as there are a number of mitigating factors that soften the blow,” DiPalma wrote in a note, adding that Viasat still has global coverage following its Inmarsat acquisition, can use a second satellite to cover North America and will likely receive a hefty insurance claim from the issue.

      "['Twitter Inc. asked a federal court in California Thursday to terminate or pare back an order that requires the Federal Trade Commission to oversee the company’s privacy practices. Twitter’s lawyers wrote that the FTC intensified an investigation into Twitter once billionaire Elon Musk bought the platform last March, opening up an investigation into the company that “has spiraled out of control and become tainted by bias.” Twitter in the filing said the FTC has “pummeled” the company with “burdensome letters and requests for depositions,” issuing demands for information as frequently as one letter every other week. The FTC sought to depose Musk on July 25, according to the filing, but FTC Chair Lina Khan declined to meet with him personally until Twitter complied with the information requests. An employee of Ernst & Young, the consulting firm brought in to assess Twitter’s privacy practices, said in a deposition he believed the agency was “trying to influence the outcome of the engagement before it had started,” according to the filing.  The FTC had no comment Thursday about Twitter’s request.  Several hours after Twitter filed the complaint, Khan testified before the House Judiciary Committee, which is led by Republicans who grilled her over her leadership of the antitrust and consumer protection agency. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said Khan and the FTC had engaged in “targeted harassment of Twitter.” The Republicans on the committee earlier this year subpoenaed documents from Khan related to its ongoing probe of Twitter, arguing the agency’s investigation amounted to an “abuse of its statutory authorities.”  Khan defended the agency’s right to probe Twitter, pointing out that the company has previously violated privacy rules. “Twitter today has access to personal sensitive information,” Khan said. “Whenever we have repeat offenders at the agency, we are thinking about what we can do to prevent repeat violations.” Twitter is currently under a consent decree with the FTC, meaning the agency is overseeing the company’s privacy practices. The FTC deepened its investigation into Twitter after Musk fired thousands of employees, some of whom were charged with protecting privacy and security on Twitter.  The FTC has insisted it is doing its job to protect Americans’ privacy. Some Democrats during the hearing on Thursday defended the agency’s work. “Protecting user privacy is not political,” said New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the committee.']\n",

      "['Amazon.com Inc. rose as much as 2.1% in pre-market trading after reporting record sales during its Prime Day sale. Tuesday, the first day of the event, was the biggest sales day in its history, Amazon said in a releaseBloomberg Terminal. The Seattle-based company said shoppers purchased more than 375 million items during the two-day sale, which Amazon typically holds in the summer to reward existing members and attract new ones before the holiday season. Prime members pay $139 a year in the US for shipping discounts, streaming video and other perks. Amazon doesn’t break out the financial metrics of its biggest sale, instead releasing mostly anecdotal information about top sellers. Adobe Inc. is scheduled to release its tally of total US online sales Thursday morning.      Google’s Bard artificial intelligence chatbot will answer a question about how many pandas live in zoos quickly, and with a surfeit of confidence. Ensuring that the response is well-sourced and based on evidence, however, falls to thousands of outside contractors from companies including Appen Ltd. and Accenture Plc, who can make as little as $14 an hour and labor with minimal training under frenzied deadlines, according to several contractors, who declined to be named for fear of losing their jobs. The contractors are the invisible backend of the generative AI boom that’s hyped to change everything. Chatbots like Bard use computer intelligence to respond almost instantly to a range of queries spanning all of human knowledge and creativity. But to improve those responses so they can be reliably delivered again and again, tech companies rely on actual people who review the answers, provide feedback on mistakes and weed out any inklings of bias. It’s an increasingly thankless job. Six current Google contract workers said that as the company entered a AI arms race with rival OpenAI over the past year, the size of their workload and complexity of their tasks increased. Without specific expertise, they were trusted to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Documents shared with Bloomberg show convoluted instructions that workers must apply to tasks with deadlines for auditing answers that can be as short as three minutes. “As it stands right now, people are scared, stressed, underpaid, don’t know what’s going on,” said one of the contractors. “And that culture of fear is not conducive to getting the quality and the teamwork that you want out of all of us.” Google has positioned its AI products as public resources in health, education and everyday life. But privately and publicly, the contractors have raised concerns about their working conditions, which they say hurt the quality of what users see. One Google contract staffer who works for Appen said in a letter to Congress in May that the speed at which they are required to review content could lead to Bard becoming a “faulty” and “dangerous” product. Google has made AI a major priority across the company, rushing to infuse the new technology into its flagship products after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google opened up Bard to 180 countries and territories and unveiled experimental AI features in marquee products like search, email and Google Docs. Google positions itself as superior to the competition because of its access to “the breadth of the world’s knowledge.”  “We undertake extensive work to build our AI products responsibly, including rigorous testing, training, and feedback processes we’ve honed for years to emphasize factuality and reduce biases,” Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said in a statement. The company said it isn’t only relying on the raters to improve the AI, and that there are a number of other methods for improving its accuracy and quality. Read More:  Google’s Rush to Win in AI Led to Ethical Lapses, Employees Say To prepare for the public using these products, workers said they started getting AI-related tasks as far back as January. One trainer, employed by Appen, was recently asked to compare two answers providing information about the latest news on Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care, rating the responses by helpfulness and relevance. Workers are also frequently asked to determine whether the AI model’s answers contain verifiable evidence. Raters are asked to decide whether a response is helpful based on six-point guidelines that include analyzing answers for things like specificity, freshness of information and coherence.  They are also asked to make sure the responses don’t “contain harmful, offensive, or overly sexual content,” and don’t “contain inaccurate, deceptive, or misleading information.” Surveying the AI’s responses for misleading content should be “based on your current knowledge or quick web search,” the guidelines say. “You do not need to perform a rigorous fact check” when assessing the answers for helpfulness. The example answer to “Who is Michael Jackson?” included an inaccuracy about the singer starring in the movie “Moonwalker” — which the AI said was released in 1983. The movie actually came out in 1988. “While verifiably incorrect,” the guidelines state, “this fact is minor in the context of answering the question, ‘Who is Michael Jackson?’” Even if the inaccuracy seems small, “it is still troubling that the chatbot is getting main facts wrong,” said  Alex Hanna, the director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and a former Google AI ethicist. “It seems like that’s a recipe to exacerbate the way these tools will look like they’re giving details that are correct, but are not,” she said.  Raters say they are assessing high-stakes topics for Google’s AI products.  One of the examples in the instructions, for instance, talks about evidence that a rater could use to determine the right dosages for a medication to treat high blood pressure, called Lisinopril. Google said that some workers concerned about accuracy of content may not have been training specifically for accuracy, but for tone, presentation and other attributes it tests. “Ratings are deliberately performed on a sliding scale to get more precise feedback to improve these models,” the company said. “Such ratings don’t directly impact the output of our models and they are by no means the only way we promote accuracy.”  Read the contract staffers’ instructions for training Google’s generative AI here:   Ed Stackhouse, the Appen worker who sent the letter to Congress, said in an interview that contract staffers were being asked to do AI labeling work on Google’s products “because we’re indispensable to AI as far as this training.” But he and other workers said they appeared to be graded for their work in mysterious, automated ways. They have no way to communicate with Google directly, besides providing feedback in a “comments” entry on each individual task. And they have to move fast. “We’re getting flagged by a type of AI telling us not to take our time on the AI,” Stackhouse added. Google disputed the workers’ description of being automatically flagged by AI for exceeding time targets. At the same time, the company said that Appen is responsible for all performance reviews for employees. Appen did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Accenture said the company does not comment on client work. Other technology companies training AI products also hire human contractors to improve them. In January,  Time reported that laborers in Kenya, paid $2 an hour, had worked to make ChatGPT less toxic. Other tech giants, including Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. make use of subcontracted staff to moderate social network content and product reviews, and to provide technical support and customer service. “If you want to ask, what is the secret sauce of Bard and ChatGPT? It’s all of the internet. And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

      "['PowerFlex Systems Inc. has installed 415 electric-vehicle charging ports across the US for DHL Express, as the logistics giant electrifies its fleet of bright yellow delivery vans. The deployment comes as the logistics industry grapples with ways to decarbonize a business long based on fossil fuels. DHL’s corporate parent, Deutsche Post DHL Group, has set a goal to eliminate net emissions from its logistics operations by 2050 and aims to deploy more than 80,000 electric vehicles worldwide by 2030. Based in San Diego, PowerFlex installs and coordinates solar arrays, batteries and electric car chargers for corporate clients. While many public EV charging networks in the US focus on deploying high-speed chargers, PowerFlex recommended DHL use slower “level 2” chargers which, at a total installation price of $6000 to $8000 each, cost far less and place less strain on the electrical grid, PowerFlex Chief Executive Officer Raphael Declercq, said in an interview.  The stakes for the DHL project, he said, were higher than many corporate charging deployments, in which businesses offer EV charging to staff as a perk.  “It’s one thing to disappoint employees because you said you were going to have charging at work and it’s not working one day. It’s another thing to miss a shift for a company like DHL,” Declercq said. “What matters is whether all the vans that day have the energy they need to drive their routes.”  PowerFlex is majority-owned by EDF Renewables North America, part of European utility giant Electricite de France SA.

      "['3D Systems Corp. has substantially sweetened its bid for rival 3D printer company Stratasys Ltd., after its last two offers were rejected as too low.  3D Systems announced cash-and-stock bid that values Stratasys at about $24.07 a share, according to a statementBloomberg Terminal Thursday, confirming a Bloomberg News report. Its last two offers were worth about $20 and $19 a share, respectively. Under the binding offer, Stratasys shareholders would now get about 1.54 shares of 3D Systems for each unit of stock they own, along with $7.50 a share in cash. At that price, Stratasys investors would own about 44% of the combined company, up from 41% under the last offer.  Stratasys rose 7% to $20.54 at 9:31 a.m. in New York trading Thursday, giving the company a market value of about $1.4 billion. The sweetened bid ramps up a four-way takeover battle, underscoring the race for scale in the fast-growing 3D printer space.  Stratasys agreed in May to acquire Desktop Metal Inc. in an all-stock deal that would create a 3D printer company valued at about $1.8 billion. Stratasys has also been rebuffingBloomberg Terminal takeover overtures from 3D printer rival Nano Dimension Ltd., which this week upped an unsolicited, partial tender offer to $24 per share.  “We have continued to pursue a friendly combination with Stratasys with the objective of maximizing value for the shareholders of both companies,” 3D Systems Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Graves said in a statement. “Multiple large Stratasys shareholders have reached out to inform us that they believe a combination of 3D Systems and Stratasys is the right path forward.”  3D Systems also delivered to Stratasys a signed merger agreement in escrow and agreed to pay any termination fees the target would owe to Desktop Metal, should shareholders fail to approve that deal. The 3D Systems offer is also not contingent on any debt or equity financing conditions.  A representative for Stratasys declined to comment.  Using a digital design as a guide, 3D printers can make objects from a variety of materials such as plastics, metal and cement. According to the Stratasys website, its products can be used in a range of industries including aerospace, automotive, consumer products and medical.  3D Systems has said that a pairing between the companies would create a dominant player in the space, with a greater range of technologies. It also said that together the companies could cut about $100 million in costs. ']\n",

      "['      Over the weekend, tech Twitter couldn’t stop talking about a bed-wetting. It started after an industry executive posted about his techified mattress made by a company called Eight Sleep Inc., which has raised about $165 million from venture capitalists. The startup offers “intelligent sleep tech” – including slumber tracking, automatic temperature adjustments with heating and cooling for each side of the bed, and a built-in alarm to “wake you up with a gradual temperature change and a subtle, chest-level vibration on your side.” The problem? Much like a water bed, apparently sometimes it leaks. On Saturday, @ericdwolan posted a photo of a soaked mattress, writing, “The annual ‘my @eightsleep sprung a leak and I need a replacement.’” He added: “I love this product but wish it didn’t break so often.” Others chimed in to say that leakage was a common occurrence for them, too. One Twitter user said the flood of liquid cost him a security deposit for an apartment.  These issues have not deterred some of tech’s highest-profile figures from using the products. This year, Elon Musk responded to a promotional Eight Sleep tweet with the praise: “It’s good.” Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg recently posted on his new Threads app that he gets seven to eight hours of shut-eye each night, in part thanks to Eight Sleep. And venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said on Sunday that he uses the device.  The startup’s investors include big names like baseball player Alex Rodriguez, AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt. Perhaps the most notable Eight Sleep user, though, is Bryan Johnson, the software entrepreneur who spends $2 million a year  trying to avoid aging.  What about the leakage? “We take all customer issues extremely seriously,” the company said in a statement. “And when we become aware of a leak we promptly take care of our members and ship a warranty replacement as quickly as within 24 hours.” Eight Sleep added that only a “small fraction” of its customers have reported that the products leave their beds wet. Its latest version “has more durable materials, a special waterproof layer, and is rigorously tested to simulate 10 years of use and as a result leaks are rare.” Even with a speedy replacement, the case of a “smart” mattress or mattress cover that sometimes wets itself is a particularly funny example of what happens when Silicon Valley sets out to reinvent a product that may not have needed it (in this case, a bed). The incident calls to mind Juicero, an internet-connected $400 juicer that purported to draw more nutrients out of single-serve packets of fruits and vegetables. It turned out, per a  Bloomberg report, that the packets could be squeezed just as effectively by hand.  Eight Sleep may offer more temperature control than a normal mattress, but there are some downsides to bringing too much technology into the bedroom. Plus, the company’s latest model is priced at over $3,000. As evidenced by its famous devotees, it’s clear that Silicon Valley will continue its inexorable march toward the optimally quantified life; but a cheaper way to control the temperature might be a fan.  AI is making politics easier, cheaper and more dangerous. Voters are seeing AI-generated campaign materials — and likely don’t know it. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was among the US officials whose emails were breached in a  hack of government accounts that Microsoft said originated from China. Microsoft is set for a second shot at winning UK approval of its $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, but regulators warned that any antitrust fixes would trigger a new probe, potentially further delaying the biggest gaming deal in history. The latest sign of investors’ unrelenting demand for all things AI-related: a record rally in drug discovery firm Recursion Pharmaceuticals following an investment from Nvidia. Wipro, the Indian outsourcing provider, plans to spend $1 billion to train its 250,000 employees in AI and integrate the technology into its product offerings. US consumers spent $6.4 billion online in the first 24 hours of Amazon’s Prime Day, according to Adobe. That’s up 6% from a year ago but fell short of estimates for even stronger growth.

      "['Huawei Technologies Co. made $560 million in revenue from its patent licensing deals last year, disclosing for the first time its annual income from that part of the business. The Shenzhen-based company has collected slightly more in royalties than it paid out over the past two years because of its falling smartphone sales, according to Alan Fan, head of its intellectual property rights department. Huawei has had to remake itself after Washington’s strict sanctions cut off its access to a wide spectrum of chips and software using American technology. The firm controls some of the key patents in wireless communications, where cross-licensing of technologies is a common practice among competitors. As one of the 5G pioneers, it’s signed patent agreements with global leaders like smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co. and auto marque Mercedes-Benz Group AG. “Huawei seeks a balanced stance in collecting royalties,” Fan said. “Product sales are also essential for us, so we don’t think it’s reasonable to ask excessive amounts for patent fees.” Licensing royalties are usually collected on the basis of the number of devices a company sells. The royalty gains will be used to fund Huawei’s research and development efforts, according to Fan. The company spent one quarter of its 2022 sales, about 161.5 billion yuan ($22.5 billion), on R&D last year. Top Huawei executives have sought to reassure the wireless industry that it has no intention to weaponize its patent trove to counter US sanctions. The company pledged to cap the maximum royalty charges it would ask for a number of products, ranging from smartphones to WiFi technologies. The rate cap for 5G handsets is $2.50 per unit, the company said.']\n",

      "['South Africa’s government is stepping up its support for some of the country’s biggest companies to help them hunt for business in Africa and protect them against extortion.  Naledi Pandor, the foreign minister, and state officials met with business executives this week to discuss how South Africa could present itself as “a unified force” when operating on the continent, and ensure companies take full advantage of the available opportunities, said Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. A platform has been created for South African countries that are active on the continent to share experiences and ideas with their peers, he said.  The initiative comes as companies including Vodacom Group Ltd. and MTN Group Ltd., Africa’s biggest mobile-phone companies, deal with disputes in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon respectively. South Africa corporates have also faced challenges in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana, and the government bemoaned the lack of uniform rules and guidelines in Africa pertaining to operating procedures and dispute resolution.    Read more: MTN Fights ‘Bizarre’ Funds Seizure in Cameroon Over Dispute  “When certain governments are running out of funds, they target South African companies, or at least it appears that way,” Monyela said in a phone interview. “In some of the countries they operate in, someone will wake up and say you owe us money and there is no rational for that. In other instances, they are slapped with taxes they know nothing about. Literally it is extortion.” Vodacom is currently embroiled in a tax dispute in the Congo, where the authorities at one point sealed off its offices and confiscated some of its executives’ passports. MTN is meanwhile trying to regain control over funds in Cameroon, after the government froze its bank accounts and sought to transfer the money into a third-party account. The move stems from a disagreement between a local businessman and a South African bank that’s unrelated to the mobile company’s operations.  The South African government plans to elevate its firms’ concerns to the African Union and ask that the continental body adopt protocols on how companies and investors on the continent should be treated, and discuss how to address difficulties in repatriating funds from some markets, according to Monyela.  Issues pertaining to specific industries such as telecommunications, energy and infrastructure will be addressed by working groups that is expected to result in executives collaborating with high level government officials, he said.

      "['China has loosened some of the guardrails it proposed for ChatGPT-style services months ago, as it acknowledges the need to compete for global leadership in artificial intelligence. The finalized guidelines, one of the world’s first major moves to regulate the nascent technology, removed some specific restrictions from the initial draft released in April, signaling a more flexible and accommodating approach. The 24 guidelines, set out in a statement Thursday, will go into effect on Aug. 15 and will be overseen by seven state agencies, led by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the nation’s top internet regulator. The National Development and Reform Commission along with the country’s education, science and technology ministries have also been added in the final version. Among the various provisions are requirements for platform providers to carry out a security review and register their services with the government, as was required in the April draft. While the final edition still places much of the regulatory burden on platforms, it injects a focus on development and innovation alongside security safeguards for the strategic AI industry, which lies at the core of Beijing’s tech rivalry with Washington. “The final version of the law significantly watered down many stringent requirements in the earlier draft released by the CAC, sending a strong signal of cautious and tolerant approach in the oversight of generative AI,” said Angela Zhang, director of the Center for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong. Offshore providers of generative AI tools — if they are aimed at Chinese residents — must also comply with the set of rules, but Chinese-developed tools that only serve overseas users are exempted. “This means more opportunities will be in enterprise-facing applications and people will be more cautious about consumer-facing entrepreneurship,” said Frances Du, founding partner of J Ventures. “However, now that there are seven agencies involved, that will make it harder to gauge the specific execution style.” The official guidelines remove provisions from the draft that included fines as high as 100,000 yuan ($14,000) for violations, as well as the requirement for platform operators to act within a three-month grace period to rectify problematic content. The articles encourage “the use of secure and trustworthy chips, software, tools, algorithms, and data sources,” and urge China’s developers of AI chips, models and software to help set international standards and pursue technological exchange. Read more: Billionaires and Bureaucrats Mobilize China for AI Race With US The document is the product of months of consultation between the government and industry players.

China’s regulation of the nascent sector will offer one model for the orderly development of AI and its distribution as a service for businesses and consumers. Legal experts had raised concerns after the draft version of the regulations, saying it placed the bulk of responsibility for governing AI content on the platform operators. The fear is that overly onerous regulations could limit the industry’s development, at a time when China is seeking to catch up to and surpass the US in the technology. You Chuanman, director of the IIA Center for Regulation and Global Governance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Shenzhen campus, said the final version of the regulations appeared to allow greater flexibility by removing specifics in the grace period and by adding a greater focus on promoting development. “A clear-cut deadline of three months could be a daunting challenge,” You said. “In the overall content, there are quite a few additions of clauses to promote development, and there is more emphasis placed on the use of existing legal tools.” Changes in the final guidelines:']\n",

      "['Tension between the crypto and banking sectors bubbled anew when Coinbase Global Inc.’s chief executive started a Twitter poll on whether Bank of America Corp. is closing accounts that transact with the exchange. Brian Armstrong tagged Bank of America’s Twitter handle when he posed the question late Wednesday in the US, saying he was “curious if this is the issue.” Armstrong began the poll after Muneeb Ali, co-founder of blockchain firm Stacks, claimed on Twitter his personal account at the lender was shut after 15 years. Ali said no explanation was given and then alleged the real reason was that he’d used the account to transact with Coinbase for Bitcoin investments. The poll question got over 8,500 responses by 7:45 a.m. Thursday in London. About 9% voted “yes,” signaling their accounts had been closed due to transactions with the largest US crypto exchange, while some 20% voted “no.” Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations or Armstrong’s poll. The banking sector globally has become increasingly doubtful about the crypto industry following a $1.5 trillion rout last year, a string of digital-asset blowups and intensifying regulatory scrutiny. US officials in particular have clamped down on crypto in the wake of the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase last month, alleging it was illegally operating an unregistered securities exchange. Coinbase has said the lawsuit lacks merit.']\n",

      "['Alphabet Inc.’s Google released its Bard chatbot to users in the European Union and Brazil, and said the artificial intelligence tool can now generate responses in more than 40 languages, including Chinese, Hindi and Spanish.  The EU is among the last part of the world to get access to Bard, which launched in about 180 countries earlier this year. The delay was due to uncertainty around the AI service’s compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, the company said. But the US tech giant had “very productive conversations with privacy regulators here in Europe,” Google Senior Product Director Jack Krawczyk told reporters ahead of the EU rollout. “We expect it to be an ongoing dialog in how we continue to build that transparency, choice and control.” He said Google will now give users clear notices about how their data are being used and stored, and let them choose not to allow the company’s employees to review conversations, which Google does to understand and improve the product. These control options will be available globally, not just in the EU.

Meta Platforms Inc. has yet to launch its newest app, Threads, in the EU’s 27 countries. This is because the company wants more time to work out how the EU will enforce new competition laws that prohibit gatekeepers from combining data between platforms, a person familiar with the matter has said. Chat services built on large language models have hit roadblocks in Europe before because of existing data protection laws. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, was temporarily shut down in Italy over related issues.  Read more: Meta’s Threads App Won’t Launch in EU on Regulatory Concerns In a company blog post timed to the announcement, Google said other features would also be coming to Bard in some regions, including the ability to hear responses spoken out loud, to upload images with prompts, and to have the AI tool analyze photos.

      "['Controversial AI theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky sits on the fringe of the industry’s most extreme circle of commentators, where extinction of the human species is the inevitable result of developing advanced artificial intelligence. “I think we\\'re not ready, I think we don\\'t know what we\\'re doing, and I think we\\'re all going to die,” Yudkowsky said on this week’s   episode of the Bloomberg Originals series  AI IRL. For the past two decades, Yudkowsky has consistently promoted his theory that hostile AI could spark a mass extinction event. As many in the AI industry shrugged or raised eyebrows at this assessment, he created the Machine Intelligence Research Institute with funding from Peter Thiel,  among others, and collaborated on  written work with futurists such as Nick Bostrom.  To say that some of his visions for the end of the world are unpopular would be a gross understatement; they’re on par with the prophecy that the world would end in 2012. That prediction was based on a questionable interpretation of an ancient text, as well as a dearth of supportive evidence. While Yudkowsky’s views are draconian, concern over AI’s potential for harm has gained traction at the highest echelons of the AI community, including among chief executive officers of some of the leading companies in artificial intelligence, such as OpenAI, Anthropic and   Alphabet Inc.\\'s DeepMind. The rapid rise of generative AI in just even the past eight months has prompted   calls for regulation and a pause in training of advanced AI systems. In May, Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis and Dario Amodei joined hundreds of other leaders and researchers   in co-signing a brief statement  released by the nonprofit Center for AI Safety that said “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Microsoft co-founder  Bill Gates was a signatory, as was Yudkowsky. Some skeptics contend that AI isn’t advanced enough to justify fears that it will destroy humanity, and that focusing on doomsday scenarios is only a distraction from issues such as algorithmic bias, racism and the risk posed by the rampant spread of disinformation.  \"This kind of talk is dangerous because it\\'s become such a dominant part of the discourse,\" Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at AI startup Hugging Face, said in an interview. \"Companies who are adding fuel to the fire are using this as a way to duck out of their responsibility. If we\\'re talking about existential risks we\\'re not looking at accountability. It’s an echo chamber that\\'s fueling panic and a real risk is that it leads to regulation that focuses on extinction scenarios and as opposed to addressing concrete, present-day harms.\" It’s also a continuation of a historic trend for transformative technologies sparking fear, uncertainty and doubt about the risk to health and humanity. Ahead of the year 2000, society had an expensive, collective panic about the so-called millennium bug. In reality, the Y2K frenzy was a case of well-meaning preparation that kickstarted system administrators the world over to check for problems, just to be on the safe side.  More recently, the proliferation of fifth-generation mobile networks was met with anger by individuals who felt the promise of benefits to communication, intelligent buildings and connected vehicles was vastly outweighed by the unsubstantiated health risks caused by electromagnetic radiation from 5G towers. But even if some of Yudkowsky’s allies don’t entirely buy his regular predictions of AI doom, they argue his motives are altruistic and that for all his hyperbole, he’s worth hearing out.']\n",

      "['Commission-free investing platform Public.com is launching in the UK, marking the Robinhood rival’s first expansion outside its American home market. The New York-headquartered firm will allow British retail investors to trade more than 5,000 US stocks and access additional services such as data and research from Thursday, Leif Abraham, co-CEO and co-founder of Public, said in an interview. The company, which also offers investing in US Treasuries, exchange-traded funds, crypto and alternative assets in the US, plans to eventually expand the products it offers in the UK and move into other European countries, Abraham said. “The goal is to have the same product experience in all markets,” Abraham said. “We are big believers in being a multi-asset investment platform.”  The UK market has traditionally been tough to crack for US stock-trading apps. Robinhood itself attempted several unsuccessful launches in the country since 2019, most recently via the now-scrapped acquisition of London-based crypto trading firm Ziglu. Instead, competition largely comes from UK-native businesses like Freetrade, Lightyear and Revolut. Read more: UK Warns Trading Apps to Review ‘Game-Like’ Design Features Unlike sector-pioneer Robinhood, Public does not make money through payment for order flow, a controversial practice where market makers pay brokerages to route orders through them, rather than directly to stock exchanges. Favored by zero-commission trading apps, the practice was banned in the UK in 2012.  Instead, Public says it earns revenue through services like its premium accounts and a voluntary tipping system. Once it’s live in the UK, the company will charge FX fees for converting British pounds to the US dollars needed to purchase US stocks.   A retail-trading boom in companies that were popular on social media during the coronavirus pandemic, known as the meme stock craze, led to several trading outfits becoming venture capital targets. Among them was Public, which raised $220 million in 2021 from investors including Accel, Greycroft, Lakestar and Tiger Global at a $1.2 billion valuation.  But enthusiasm among retail investors for equities trading has been more muted in the months since, while venture capital investment in financial technology startups has dried up. While Public is not yet profitable, it continues to grow and has a “healthy cash balance at the bank,” Abraham said.  “The funding markets have changed but this year has been the best year to date for us ever,” Abraham said, without disclosing exact figures. “The first two quarters were the best in the history of the company.” The firm, which also has offices in Copenhagen, London and Amsterdam, looked at several alternatives when deciding where to kick off its international expansion. It ultimately opted for the UK as a result of the market’s size and the fact that it already has an English-speaking product, according to Abraham. “The UK population remains very savvy, very open and accepting towards digital financial products whether it’s a lending app, banking or investing,” Dann Bibas, Public.com’s general manager for international and former head of investments at UK fintech giant Wise, said in an interview.']\n",

      "['Doomsayers have long prophesized an apocalypse caused by new technologies. And yet somehow we’re still here. Why is artificial intelligence any different, asks Bloomberg’s Nate Lanxon. Google’s Bard artificial intelligence chatbot will answer a question about how many pandas live in zoos quickly, and with a surfeit of confidence. Ensuring that the response is well-sourced and based on evidence, however, falls to thousands of outside contractors from companies including Appen Ltd. and Accenture Plc, who can make as little as $14 an hour and labor with minimal training under frenzied deadlines, according to several contractors, who declined to be named for fear of losing their jobs. The contractors are the invisible backend of the generative AI boom that’s hyped to change everything. Chatbots like Bard use computer intelligence to respond almost instantly to a range of queries spanning all of human knowledge and creativity. But to improve those responses so they can be reliably delivered again and again, tech companies rely on actual people who review the answers, provide feedback on mistakes and weed out any inklings of bias. It’s an increasingly thankless job. Six current Google contract workers said that as the company entered a AI arms race with rival OpenAI over the past year, the size of their workload and complexity of their tasks increased. Without specific expertise, they were trusted to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Documents shared with Bloomberg show convoluted instructions that workers must apply to tasks with deadlines for auditing answers that can be as short as three minutes. “As it stands right now, people are scared, stressed, underpaid, don’t know what’s going on,” said one of the contractors. “And that culture of fear is not conducive to getting the quality and the teamwork that you want out of all of us.” Google has positioned its AI products as public resources in health, education and everyday life. But privately and publicly, the contractors have raised concerns about their working conditions, which they say hurt the quality of what users see. One Google contract staffer who works for Appen said in a letter to Congress in May that the speed at which they are required to review content could lead to Bard becoming a “faulty” and “dangerous” product. Google has made AI a major priority across the company, rushing to infuse the new technology into its flagship products after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google opened up Bard to 180 countries and territories and unveiled experimental AI features in marquee products like search, email and Google Docs. Google positions itself as superior to the competition because of its access to “the breadth of the world’s knowledge.”  “We undertake extensive work to build our AI products responsibly, including rigorous testing, training, and feedback processes we’ve honed for years to emphasize factuality and reduce biases,” Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said in a statement. The company said it isn’t only relying on the raters to improve the AI, and that there are a number of other methods for improving its accuracy and quality. Read More:  Google’s Rush to Win in AI Led to Ethical Lapses, Employees Say To prepare for the public using these products, workers said they started getting AI-related tasks as far back as January. One trainer, employed by Appen, was recently asked to compare two answers providing information about the latest news on Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care, rating the responses by helpfulness and relevance. Workers are also frequently asked to determine whether the AI model’s answers contain verifiable evidence. Raters are asked to decide whether a response is helpful based on six-point guidelines that include analyzing answers for things like specificity, freshness of information and coherence.  They are also asked to make sure the responses don’t “contain harmful, offensive, or overly sexual content,” and don’t “contain inaccurate, deceptive, or misleading information.” Surveying the AI’s responses for misleading content should be “based on your current knowledge or quick web search,” the guidelines say. “You do not need to perform a rigorous fact check” when assessing the answers for helpfulness. The example answer to “Who is Michael Jackson?” included an inaccuracy about the singer starring in the movie “Moonwalker” — which the AI said was released in 1983. The movie actually came out in 1988. “While verifiably incorrect,” the guidelines state, “this fact is minor in the context of answering the question, ‘Who is Michael Jackson?’” Even if the inaccuracy seems small, “it is still troubling that the chatbot is getting main facts wrong,” said  Alex Hanna, the director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and a former Google AI ethicist. “It seems like that’s a recipe to exacerbate the way these tools will look like they’re giving details that are correct, but are not,” she said.  Raters say they are assessing high-stakes topics for Google’s AI products.  One of the examples in the instructions, for instance, talks about evidence that a rater could use to determine the right dosages for a medication to treat high blood pressure, called Lisinopril. Google said that some workers concerned about accuracy of content may not have been training specifically for accuracy, but for tone, presentation and other attributes it tests. “Ratings are deliberately performed on a sliding scale to get more precise feedback to improve these models,” the company said. “Such ratings don’t directly impact the output of our models and they are by no means the only way we promote accuracy.”  Read the contract staffers’ instructions for training Google’s generative AI here:   Ed Stackhouse, the Appen worker who sent the letter to Congress, said in an interview that contract staffers were being asked to do AI labeling work on Google’s products “because we’re indispensable to AI as far as this training.” But he and other workers said they appeared to be graded for their work in mysterious, automated ways. They have no way to communicate with Google directly, besides providing feedback in a “comments” entry on each individual task. And they have to move fast. “We’re getting flagged by a type of AI telling us not to take our time on the AI,” Stackhouse added. Google disputed the workers’ description of being automatically flagged by AI for exceeding time targets. At the same time, the company said that Appen is responsible for all performance reviews for employees. Appen did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Accenture said the company does not comment on client work. Other technology companies training AI products also hire human contractors to improve them. In January,  Time reported that laborers in Kenya, paid $2 an hour, had worked to make ChatGPT less toxic. Other tech giants, including Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. make use of subcontracted staff to moderate social network content and product reviews, and to provide technical support and customer service. “If you want to ask, what is the secret sauce of Bard and ChatGPT? It’s all of the internet. And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

      "['Siemens AG unveiled a €1 billion ($1.1 billion) investment in Germany, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz heralding the plan as his coalition works to reverse an exodus of capital from Europe’s biggest economy. Scholz is sharing the stage on Thursday with Chief Executive Officer Roland Busch at Siemens’ vast facility in Erlangen, Bavaria, where the company will build a new 200,000 square meter technology campus and expand production capacity. The plan — part of the company’s previously announced €2 billion global investment program — marks a victory for the Social Democrat leader and his ruling coalition in Berlin as they try to respond threats to the longer-term outlook for manufacturing. Steep energy prices, a crippling shortage of skilled workers and subsidies in the US and Asia risk have fueled dire warnings from lobby groups that a creeping de-industrialization could take hold.  Some data support the warnings. More than €135 billion of direct investment flowed out of Germany last year, while only €10.5 billion came in — deepening an “alarming” trend, the German Economic Institute warned in a recent report.  The pain is being felt across German manufacturing. Chemical behemoth BASF AG has closed a number of energy-intensive factories at its main Ludwigshafen site. At the same time, cheaper energy and lucrative green-tech subsidies in the US have put Europe on the defensive to protect investments from carmakers and battery producers like Stellantis NV and Northvolt AB.  Scholz said in a statement that Siemens’ investment sent “a strong signal for Germany as a location for innovation and production.” Once focused on heavy-duty equipment, Siemens has revamped its business to center on higher-margin, software-driven products, such as factory automation devices and smart infrastructure to help industrial customers reduce their carbon footprint. The shift has driven profits in recent years. Erlangen is Siemens’ largest location globally. In addition to hosting research and development, it’s the administrative home for large parts of its train-making, mobility solutions and smart infrastructure units. The spun-off health-care division Siemens Healthineers is also headquartered there, where it manufactures medical-imaging devices. Siemens has already announced that will convert former research facilities in the Bavarian town into a 540,000 square meter campus for more than 20,000 employees until the mid-2030s. Siemens is also expanding in other regions, having already earmarked €340 million for factories in Singapore and China, and roughly €200 million to expand rail manufacturing in the US. Siemens isn’t receiving subsidies for the German investment, Busch told reporters on Thursday. The chancellor attended the signing ceremony in June for a deal with Intel Corp to build a €30 billion semiconductor plant in Magdeburg — a project that included about €10 billion in German subsidies. In May, Infineon Technologies AG hosted Scholz to break ground on a €5 billion chip plant in Dresden. And in February, Scholz met with business and political leaders in Saarland to celebrate a $3 billion deal between auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen and US semiconductor maker Wolfspeed Inc. to make chips for EVs. Meanwhile, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who heads the business-friendly Free Democrats, is planning a raft of measures designed to boost climate-friendly investments by small and medium-sized enterprises, according to a government paper distributed Wednesday. The plan, which the government estimates would ease the tax burden on companies and households by about €6 billion a year, includes subsidies that are part of the ruling coalition’s blueprint to help companies speed the process of cutting emissions. At the same time, Lindner is pushing to consolidate the federal government’s finances after it borrowed record amounts to fund spending to offset the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. Yet, there are few broader indications that the string of deals has been enough to swing the momentum to Germany’s favor. Industrial production has continued to fall this year, and with it investor confidence. Concerns among political leaders and executives are growing that the economy is taking longer than they expected to rebound from its winter recession.']\n",

The contractors are the invisible backend of the generative AI boom that’s hyped to change everything. Chatbots like Bard use computer intelligence to respond almost instantly to a range of queries spanning all of human knowledge and creativity. But to improve those responses so they can be reliably delivered again and again, tech companies rely on actual people who review the answers, provide feedback on mistakes and weed out any inklings of bias. It’s an increasingly thankless job. Six current Google contract workers said that as the company entered a AI arms race with rival OpenAI over the past year, the size of their workload and complexity of their tasks increased. Without specific expertise, they were trusted to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Documents shared with Bloomberg show convoluted instructions that workers must apply to tasks with deadlines for auditing answers that can be as short as three minutes. “As it stands right now, people are scared, stressed, underpaid, don’t know what’s going on,” said one of the contractors. “And that culture of fear is not conducive to getting the quality and the teamwork that you want out of all of us.” Google has positioned its AI products as public resources in health, education and everyday life. But privately and publicly, the contractors have raised concerns about their working conditions, which they say hurt the quality of what users see. One Google contract staffer who works for Appen said in a letter to Congress in May that the speed at which they are required to review content could lead to Bard becoming a “faulty” and “dangerous” product. Google has made AI a major priority across the company, rushing to infuse the new technology into its flagship products after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google opened up Bard to 180 countries and territories and unveiled experimental AI features in marquee products like search, email and Google Docs. Google positions itself as superior to the competition because of its access to “the breadth of the world’s knowledge.”  “We undertake extensive work to build our AI products responsibly, including rigorous testing, training, and feedback processes we’ve honed for years to emphasize factuality and reduce biases,” Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said in a statement. The company said it isn’t only relying on the raters to improve the AI, and that there are a number of other methods for improving its accuracy and quality. Read More:  Google’s Rush to Win in AI Led to Ethical Lapses, Employees Say To prepare for the public using these products, workers said they started getting AI-related tasks as far back as January. One trainer, employed by Appen, was recently asked to compare two answers providing information about the latest news on Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care, rating the responses by helpfulness and relevance. Workers are also frequently asked to determine whether the AI model’s answers contain verifiable evidence. Raters are asked to decide whether a response is helpful based on six-point guidelines that include analyzing answers for things like specificity, freshness of information and coherence.  They are also asked to make sure the responses don’t “contain harmful, offensive, or overly sexual content,” and don’t “contain inaccurate, deceptive, or misleading information.” Surveying the AI’s responses for misleading content should be “based on your current knowledge or quick web search,” the guidelines say. “You do not need to perform a rigorous fact check” when assessing the answers for helpfulness. The example answer to “Who is Michael Jackson?” included an inaccuracy about the singer starring in the movie “Moonwalker” — which the AI said was released in 1983. The movie actually came out in 1988. “While verifiably incorrect,” the guidelines state, “this fact is minor in the context of answering the question, ‘Who is Michael Jackson?’” Even if the inaccuracy seems small, “it is still troubling that the chatbot is getting main facts wrong,” said  Alex Hanna, the director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and a former Google AI ethicist. “It seems like that’s a recipe to exacerbate the way these tools will look like they’re giving details that are correct, but are not,” she said.  Raters say they are assessing high-stakes topics for Google’s AI products.  One of the examples in the instructions, for instance, talks about evidence that a rater could use to determine the right dosages for a medication to treat high blood pressure, called Lisinopril. Google said that some workers concerned about accuracy of content may not have been training specifically for accuracy, but for tone, presentation and other attributes it tests. “Ratings are deliberately performed on a sliding scale to get more precise feedback to improve these models,” the company said. “Such ratings don’t directly impact the output of our models and they are by no means the only way we promote accuracy.”  Read the contract staffers’ instructions for training Google’s generative AI here:   Ed Stackhouse, the Appen worker who sent the letter to Congress, said in an interview that contract staffers were being asked to do AI labeling work on Google’s products “because we’re indispensable to AI as far as this training.” But he and other workers said they appeared to be graded for their work in mysterious, automated ways. They have no way to communicate with Google directly, besides providing feedback in a “comments” entry on each individual task. And they have to move fast. “We’re getting flagged by a type of AI telling us not to take our time on the AI,” Stackhouse added. Google disputed the workers’ description of being automatically flagged by AI for exceeding time targets. At the same time, the company said that Appen is responsible for all performance reviews for employees. Appen did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Accenture said the company does not comment on client work. Other technology companies training AI products also hire human contractors to improve them. In January,  Time reported that laborers in Kenya, paid $2 an hour, had worked to make ChatGPT less toxic. Other tech giants, including Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. make use of subcontracted staff to moderate social network content and product reviews, and to provide technical support and customer service. “If you want to ask, what is the secret sauce of Bard and ChatGPT? It’s all of the internet. And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

      "['Singapore’s new digital banks backed by Grab Holdings Ltd. and Sea Ltd. are pushing the country’s central bank to lift a cap on deposits that they see as hamstringing their growth. Both banks are approaching the S$50 million ($37.6 million) limit and have been lobbying the Monetary Authority of Singapore to review its stance, according to people with knowledge of the matter. They expect to hear an update on this issue soon, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are confidential.  While the deposit cap during the lenders’ first two years of operation is meant to safeguard consumers’ interests, the new entrants see the restriction — that has meant applications for their savings accounts are by-invite only — as curbing their lending ability. Time is also ticking for these digibanks owned by non-financial firms to boost scale, given they had to show a path towards profitability within five years during their application process. Meanwhile, against a backdrop of the city-state’s banks mopping up deposit amid a glut, rival digibank Trust Bank is raking in the monies. Backed by Standard Chartered Plc, it doesn’t face the same deposit restriction.

Read more on Singapore banks’ deposit glut A spokesperson for Grab’s GXS Bank said the firm neared the regulatory cap “within months” of launching its savings account, and the waitlist to open such an account “continues to grow organically every day.” The bank, which also introduced a loan product in April, has been improving its infrastructure to ensure it can scale up quickly and securely, according to the spokesperson. It has been engaging the regulator on its progress, the spokesperson said.  MariBank said it is working closely with MAS to ensure the firm has strong frameworks to support users’ needs and its long-term development. MAS referred Bloomberg News to its previous statements for digital banks. In those statements, it had stated that the safeguards, including deposit caps, are to mitigate the risk of untested business models and minimise costs to retail depositors and the financial system in the event of operational incidents or a failure.

      "['Share sales by listed companies in India should remain active over the upcoming months as equities’ outperformance and supporting economic trends help attract foreign investors, according to Goldman Sachs. Additional share sales priced in the South Asia country in June amounted $3.3 billion, the highest tally for a month since March 2021, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The sum for the first six months of the year jumped to $6.6 billion, an increase of 140% annually, making India one of the busiest spots in Asia for such sales.   Blocks are “a leading indicator for ECM volumes in the coming weeks and months,” said Phyllis Wang, head of equity capital markets syndicate for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While sellers can “react quickly” to the environment they are seeing, recent activity has also been supported by the “quality of investors, who are aggressively looking for ways to invest into Indian equities,” she added.   Block sales, which are quicker and simpler to execute than follow-ons and traditional IPOs, come as India’s equity benchmarks continue to reach record high levels, buoyed by optimism for the country’s economic growth that’s being driven by strong domestic demand.  The NSE Nifty 50 Index is up 7.1% this year through Wednesday, versus a 5.1% gain for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Foreign inflows into Indian stocks in second quarter reached $13.6 billion, the highest for a quarter since the end of 2020. The supportive economy has helped attract long-term foreign funds to the Indian market, helping narrow the discount gap from the blocks to the reference price of the shares. More than 80% of bunched trades in Mumbai during the second quarter have priced at a discount around 1%, according to Wang. Many institutional investors are now hiring dedicated Indian specialists and building the infrastructure to trade in the country, Wang added.  Some recent sizable block trades in Mumbai included holders exiting stakes completely, such as Abrdn Investment Management Ltd. raising $498 million from the sale of its remaining shares in HDFC Asset Management Co., and Piramal Enterprises Ltd. selling all of its holding in Shriram Finance Ltd. Both HDFC AM and Shriram Finance are up more than 10% since the stake sales.  While the last quarter of 2023 was marked by many blocks that followed the end of lock-up periods for big IPOs by technology, media and telecommunication companies, now “the offerings are much more diversified by sector and size,” Wang said. “Institutional investors have noticeably broadened their universe of investable Indian equities, though valuations remain a point of focus.”']\n",

      "['Elon Musk said he believes that China is “on Team Humanity” and would be willing to work with the international community on common guidelines for artificial intelligence — a technology he described as “a civilizational risk.”  Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who took part in a Twitter Spaces discussion with Musk on Wednesday, was not so sure.  Musk, who recently returned from a trip to China, said he had warned top government officials there that digital super intelligence could try to take over their country.  The Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer said while he recognizes that he has “some vested interests in China,” his impression was that Beijing “is definitely interested in working in a cooperative international framework regarding AI regulation.” Gallagher questioned whether China has ever played a constructive role in existing global institutions. He said he sees the Chinese Communist Party as more on “Team Genocidal Communism,” citing the threat to Taiwan and the use of technology to control the Uighur population in western China.  Strategic competition with China has become one of the main arguments of those pushing for the US to forge ahead on artificial intelligence, even as some of AI’s initial investors and inventors have urged caution. Musk was one of thousands of signatories to an open letter published in March that called on AI researchers to pause development of powerful large language models to allow time for “shared safety protocols.” Wednesday’s wide-ranging conversation on Twitter, the social media platform that Musk owns, came the day that he unveiled a website for xAI, a company he said should aim for AI that is “maximally curious, maximally truth seeking” rather than being programmed with one understanding of morality. Read More: Musk Unveils xAI in New Bid to Rival Startup OpenAI Musk said he’s hopeful that relations between the US and China will improve “once the, the very difficult question of Taiwan is — you know — resolved,” although he didn’t say how.  “It’s probably gonna get hot in the Pacific — hopefully not too hot,” Musk said. “Hopefully we can get past that and get to a positive situation for the world in the spirit of: aspirationally we’re all on Team Humanity. But it’s going to get spicy.” The live Twitter Spaces event included California Representative Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley. Khanna is a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which is led by Gallagher.  While all three participants tried to end the conversation on an optimistic note by affirming that the worst case scenario for artificial intelligence is unlikely, Musk said he stays up at night trying to “figure out how do we navigate to this to the best possible future for humanity.” “It might end up being the hardest problem we’ve ever faced,” Musk said. “Nation-state battles will seem parochial ultimately compared to digital superintelligence.” ']\n",

The FTC will ask the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley’s finding that the blockbuster game deal won’t thwart competition in the markets for console, subscription and cloud gaming and harm consumers. Corley on Tuesday denied the agency’s request for a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the takeover from closing before a July 18 deadline. She extended a temporary restraining order that blocks Microsoft from closing the deal until midnight US West Coast time on Friday. The FTC’s legal challenge to the tie-up is part of an effort by commission Chair Lina Khan to more aggressively police mergers, particularly those by the biggest tech platforms.  “The facts haven’t changed,” Activision said Wednesday in a statement. “We’re confident the US will remain among the 39 countries where the merger can close. We look forward to reinforcing the strength of our case in court, again.” Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company is disappointed that “the FTC is continuing to pursue what has become a demonstrably weak case.” “The district court’s ruling makes crystal clear that this acquisition is good for both competition and consumers,” he said in a statement. Read More: Microsoft Set for New Shot at Winning UK Over on Activision Robert Lande, a professor at University of Baltimore School of Law, said Tuesday Corley was too strict about the level of certainty she required from the FTC’s case. The law only requires the agency show that a deal “may” substantially lessen competition, not that it “will” or “is likely to,” he said. “I believe the judge evaluated the case using the wrong standard and I believe the FTC should appeal,” said Lande, who gave a lecture at the FTC in March on research into how courts have applied that antitrust standard to mergers. Stanford Law Professor Doug Melamed, however, said he believes it’s unlikely the appeals court would rule before the deal’s deadline. “It’s extremely unlikely that the FTC could persuade the Court of Appeals to enjoin the merger before July 18,” said Melamed, a former Justice Department antitrust official.

      "['Apple Inc.’s contract talks with its first unionized US retail store reached a flashpoint on Wednesday, with labor representatives filing a complaint in response to what they called bad faith negotiations.  The International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, which represents the Apple store in Towson, Maryland, said that the iPhone maker is stalling and hasn’t responded to key proposals sought by employees. The group filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, citing a “clear pattern” of regressive bargaining. The union argues that Apple has made counteroffers that would merely preserve the status quo. It also complained that Apple is sharing negotiation information with the company’s other retail stores, despite asking for a closed bargaining process. “We strongly deny these claims and look forward to providing the full set of facts to the NLRB,” an Apple spokesperson said. “As always, we engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.” The company has previously denied unfair labor practice charges filed with the NLRB regarding incidents at other retail locations. The clash follows several months of bargaining between Apple and the union for the Maryland store, which represents about 100 employees. “After more than a dozen bargaining sessions, Apple continues to use stall tactics and act in ways that are not in the spirit of reaching a collective bargaining agreement,” said the machinists-affiliated group, which goes by IAM Coalition of Organized Retail Employees, or IAM CORE. Signs of escalating tension emerged on Tuesday, when the union and Apple began their latest bargaining session. Organizers said on Twitter that Apple took “egregious steps that can only be interpreted as intentional moves to derail the progress we have made so far.”  Earlier this year, Apple continued an effortBloomberg Terminal to keep other retail stores from unionizing by using its negotiations with the Towson location as a cautionary tale. It told workers that the Towson store is giving priority for time-off benefits to full-time employees — potentially making unionization less attractive to part-time workers — and said that union dues could add up over time.  So far, Apple and the union for the Towson store have reached tentative agreements on about a dozen proposals, including those related to nondiscrimination policies, a health and safety committee, and resolving paycheck errors.  Apple earlier rejected proposals on having weekly instead of biweekly pay, scheduling policies, a third-party arbitrator for resolving grievances over replacing existing procedures, a respect and dignity clause, and basing promotions and layoffs on tenure, Bloomberg News reported in April. Read More: Apple’s Unionized Store Workers Seek Tips and Higher Holiday Pay In May, the union asked Apple to implement raises of as much as 10%. It also called for changes to vacation policies, bereavement leave and overtime. And the store’s representatives asked for Apple to implement a tipping system — letting shoppers offer gratuities in increments of 3%, 5% or a custom amount — for in-store credit-card transactions. The NLRB complaint marks at least the second from the Maryland store’s union. Last year, it filed a claim with the board after Apple withheld some benefits related to education and medical insurance from unionized locations. In June, an NLRB judge ruled that the company violated employees’ rights at a New York City store by “coercively” interrogating them about pro-union sympathies and restricting the circulation of union flyers. Apple has said it disagrees with the ruling and is appealing.']\n",

      "['Google’s decision to allow developers to expand the ways nonfungible tokens can be used in their games on the Play Store was met with a collective sigh of relief on crypto Twitter.  NFT investors, who have for months watched the prices of their collections fall and interest in this colorful corner of the digital-asset market wane, see the changes in Google’s policy as a sign that the market is not dead yet. “We’re so back,” said Kyle McCollom, a co-founder at a Brooklyn-based crypto startup.  “You thought NFTs were dead?” tweeted Daniel Borovik, creator of multiple collections listed on OpenSea, the largest marketplace by volume for nonfungible tokens.  In a blog post published Wednesday, Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it will allow developers to offer games where players can buy, sell and earn tokenized digital assets—like nonfungible tokens—subject to specific guidelines.  NFTs once ranked among the crypto industry’s hottest assets, attracting the attention of celebrities like Madonna, Justin Bieber and superstar DJ Steve Aoki.  Read: Security, Art or Mere Picture: Celebrities Draw Scrutiny to NFTs But in the months since the collapse of FTX, the digital assets most closely associated with cartoonish pictures of apes have since seen their value and popularity plummet. Monthly global sales volumes for NFTs fell 38% to $653 million in June compared with the same period last year, according to blockchain data provider CryptoSlam.  Google has had a mixed strategy on blockchain and crypto: Google Play still bans crypto mining apps from its marketplace, while Google Cloud in 2021 teamed up with Dapper Labs, the creator of the NBA Top Shot digital collectibles. The move to clarify its policies also further aligns Google with main rival Apple Inc., which introduced new App Store guidelines in October on crypto trading, as well as on the use of NFTs within apps and games. Both Google and Apple have been lambasted by the crypto and gaming industries for high fees on in-app transactions. Brian Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer of crypto exchange Coinbase, publicly criticized Apple last year over these in-app transaction rules, citing their “app store monopoly.” Google Play’s updated guidelines, which go into effect Dec. 7, say that games can support transactions involving tokenized assets under the platform’s existing Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy. Developers will have to follow specific rules, such as ensuring that the value of an NFT is made clear to a player at the time of purchase.

A recent set of changes on the Ethereum blockchain has meant that these GPUs are no longer necessary, which is a problem for the Ether miners who hold large stocks of them.  Read: AI Needs Special Processors. Crypto Miners Say They Have Them The rise of ChatGPT and other apps has sparked soaring demand for high-end GPUs and related cloud services. But the pivot from crypto mining to providing high-performance computing power for AI can be difficult given the distinct setups within data centers.  Somewhere between 5% and 15% of existing crypto-oriented GPUs can be repurposed for AI and adjacent applications like computer vision and generative graphic design, according to Bitpro Consulting. Bitcoin miners face a number of headwinds despite the recent rallies in the token’s price. Rising power costs, more competition among miners and an increasingly stringent regulatory environment have weighed on their share prices. Some crypto miners have been trying to diversify their businesses to contend with the shifting economics of their industry.  Bitcoin miner Hut 8 Mining Corp. offers high-performance computing power to a variety of firms including financial services companies and gaming startups. Crusoe Energy Systems Inc. is expanding its GPU fleet to attract more AI customers, besides its Bitcoin mining operations powered by stranded gas. And Riot Platforms dropped “blockchain” from its name in January to reflect its more diversified business operations.

      "['            At around 5 a.m. in Moscow on June 29, Russian satellite communications provider Dozor-Teleport ZAO’s systems suddenly dropped offline. Hackers had targeted the company with a destructive attack and stolen troves of its internal data. It was yet another example of the ongoing cyberwar various factions have been waging against Russian companies since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  The hackers claimed affiliation with the Wagner mercenary group, which staged a short-lived mutiny against Russia’s military leadership a few days before.In a statement posted on the social media platform Telegram, a person associated with the hackers said that they had targeted Dozor because it serves power lines, oil fields and military units of the Russian Defense Ministry and the Federal Security Service, or FSB. “The information on the servers was destroyed,” wrote a spokesman, posting under the name, “Richard W.” Wagner representatives couldn’t be reached for comment.  But cybersecurity experts who examined the evidence say they doubt Wagner’s involvement — and suggest instead that Ukrainian hackers were involved. Oleg Shakirov, a Russian cybersecurity expert, told me that Wagner doesn’t have a history of deploying such attacks and says the timing – five days after the end of the aborted mutiny – makes little sense. It would have been more useful to disrupt communication during the operation. He believes Ukrainians were more likely responsible – and disguised themselves as Wagner in a thinly veiled attempt at trolling. Shakirov points out that the first online post about the hack appeared on the morning of June 29 on a Russian-language forum, by a user named “explorer,” who had created the account only two days earlier. But news of the attack didn’t spread until Andriy Baranovych, a spokesman for a group of Ukrainian hackers named the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, tweeted about it. Vito Alfano, an analyst with the Singapore-based firm Group-IB, also doubts Wagner’s involvement. On some of the stolen Dozor files, he found a timestamp of June 6 — more than two weeks before the Wagner mutiny. And on Telegram, he found no mention of the hack on the group’s long-established channels. Who was talking about it? A member of Ukraine’s Cyber Alliance, who was was promoting the claims on social media. “Surely, the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian hacktivist group, likely linked to the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance,” Alfano says.Dozor didn’t respond to requests for comment. But company director Alexander Anosov confirmed in a statement to Russian media that Dozor had suffered a cyberattack. The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, formed in 2016 to counter Russian aggression, is known for conducting successful data breaches and has taken credit for compromising Russian Ministry of Defense servers and stealing and publishing emails from an adviser close to Putin. So did the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance hack Dozor? Baranovych, who also uses the name Sean Townsend, declined to answer directly. The hackers “seemingly have reasons not to give up an attribution, so that the Russian side will remain in uncertainty” over who did it, he said. The attack on Dozor wasn’t the first on a satellite communications company to have occurred during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In February 2022, the day before Russia launched its invasion, Russian government hackers allegedly targeted US firm Viasat. That incident disrupted tens of thousands of modems in Ukraine and other parts of Europe, some for more than a month. The Dozor breach doesn’t appear to have caused the same degree of damage or disruption. But it’s a reminder that while the bullets continue to fly on the front lines, the cyber conflict shows no signs of letting up either. And in both arenas, it remains a difficult task to discern the truth amid a fog of propaganda and disinformation. Cryptocurrency-related crime is down, but ransomware attacks are on the rise, according to a new report by Chainalysis, a New York-based blockchain analysis firm. In the first six months of the year, the amount of cryptocurrencies flowing to illicit entities — not including those that have been sanctioned or subject to special measures — dropped by 65% compared to the same period in 2022, Chainalysis found. Transaction volumes for legitimate services are down too, but only by 28%. Chainalysis attributed much of the drop to the declining fortunes of crypto scammers, who have taken in nearly $3.3 billion less so far in 2023 than they did in 2022. Revenues for scammers also took a hit in 2022, but Chainalysis says this year’s drop is a bigger deal because crypto asset prices are on the rise. But the report isn’t all good news. Ransomware attackers extorted just over $175 million more from victims than they did at the same time in 2022. They’re set to rake in nearly $450 million through June, which, extrapolated, would make 2023 their second-biggest year ever after 2021. While Chainalysis says that ransomware attacks on small targets are on the rise, it attributes the rise of overall revenues to an increase in attackers going after big organizations with a lot of money.

      "[\"Elon Musk, who has hinted for months that he wants to build an alternative to the popular ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot, announced the formation of what he’s calling xAI, a company with a mission to “understand the true nature of the universe.”  On a website unveiled Wednesday, xAI said its team will be led by Musk and staffed by executives who have worked at a broad range of companies at the forefront of artificial intelligence, including Google’s DeepMind, Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc., as well as academic institutions such as the University of Toronto. Musk was involved in the creation of OpenAI, the highest-profile AI startup and developer of ChatGPT. But he has frequently and publicly criticized OpenAI since he left the board in 2018, especially after it created a for-profit arm the following year. He has said he believes it to be “effectively controlled by Microsoft.” Microsoft has invested some $13 billion into OpenAI. Elon Musk, who hinted for months that he wants to build an alternative to ChatGPT's artificial intelligence chatbot, announced the formation of what he’s calling xAI, whose goal is to “understand the true nature of the universe.”@CarolineHydeTV reports https://t.co/JfISGoHAHI pic.twitter.com/Mjcv19YmCE— Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) July 13, 2023\\n   Despite his work in AI, Musk has expressed deep reservations about the technology. The billionaire was among a group of researchers and tech industry leaders who in March called for developers to pause the training of powerful AI models. Of the 12 men, including Musk, listed on the website Wednesday morning, a majority previously worked at Google in some capacity, or at its London-based artificial intelligence unit, DeepMind. One, Christian Szegedy, spent years as a research scientist at the company. Other former Googlers are Igor Babuschkin, Zizhang Dai, Tony Wu and Toby Pohlen.    Musk’s startup has also added two academics from the University of Toronto, Guodong Zhang and Jimmy Ba, an assistant professor at who studied under AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. Both Ba and Zhang list a DeepMind internship on their CVs.  Ba is one of the best known hires announced by xAI Wednesday. He is the co-author, with Diederik Kingma, of a 2014 paper on optimization in deep learning known as the “Adam” paper. It is the most-cited paper in artificial intelligence, with 95,460 citations, according to the scientific networking site ResearchGate. Ba “has a unique brain,” said Deval Pandya, director of AI engineering at the Vector Institute, a Canadian nonprofit organization dedicated to AI research, where Ba also worked as a researcher. “He has achieved a lot of originality in methods compared to his peers,” Pandya said. Ba is currently on leave from the university, according to computer science department chair, Eyal de Lara, and is also on leave from Vector, according to the institute’s website.   Though Musk is a frequent critic of San Francisco, the xAI website says that the company is “actively recruiting experienced engineers and researchers” to work “in the Bay Area.” So far, most AI development has been concentrated in Silicon Valley.  Musk and Jared Birchall, who operates Musk’s family office, incorporated a business called X.AI in March, according to a Nevada state filing with the Secretary of State.  In April, the Financial Times reported that Musk was holding discussions with investors of his other companies, Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., about helping fund an AI startup, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The billionaire has acquired thousands of processors from Nvidia Corp. for the new project, the paper said. The xAI website said the company is being advised by Dan Hendrycks, who is the director of the Center for AI Safety — a group that has warned about what it sees as existential dangers of developing AI quickly. This spring, it released a letter of caution signed by chief executive officers of some of the leading companies in AI, including Alphabet Inc.’s DeepMind and OpenAI. Musk, 52, now oversees six companies: Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, Neuralink, Boring Co. and now xAI. In regulatory filings, Tesla says the auto giant is “increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.” Tesla’s website invites people to help “build the future of artificial intelligence” with a variety of products, from the “Tesla Bot” known as Optimus to AI interface chips that will run the electric automaker’s automated driving software. Musk has a long history of borrowing engineers from one company to help out at another, as the contours of his ever-expanding empire bleed into one another. Tesla and SpaceX share a vice president of materials engineering, for example, and engineers from Tesla “volunteered” to work at Twitter after Musk bought the company for $44 billion in October.  The xAI website says that it is a “separate company from X Corp,” the parent company that Musk merged Twitter into earlier this year, but that it will “work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies.” Musk’s dramatic entrance into the AI world has attracted notice from existing companies.“Elon is one of the great entrepreneurs of our time,” said Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and of the startup Inflection AI. Hoffman, a former board member of OpenAI, said that Musk had the credentials to advance the development of the technology.  In response to a question about the lack of women on the xAI founding team, Hoffman said it was important to have “inclusive voices” in the industry. He also criticized Musk’s call for a pause on AI development, which Musk signed onto before launching the company.  “I look a little bit askance at signing a six month pause while you’re trying to accelerate your own effort,” Hoffman said.\"]\n",

      "[\"One day in February 2022, two AI researchers at Alphabet Inc.’s Google found themselves engrossed in conversation about artificial intelligence and its potential for real applications in healthcare.  As Alan Karthikesalingam and Vivek Natarajan discussed adapting Google’s existing AI models to medical settings, their conversation stretched for hours and into dinner over dosas at a restaurant near the tech giant’s Mountain View headquarters. By the end of the evening, Natarajan had written a first draft of a document that described the possibilities for large language models in health care, including research directions and its challenges. Their work kicked off one of the most intense research sprints that researchers say they have experienced in their time at Google. It culminated in the publication of Med-PaLM, an AI model that researchers say has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by allowing physicians to retrieve medical knowledge quickly to support their clinical decisions. Large language models are massive AI systems that typically ingest enormous volumes of digital text, but Karthikesalingam and Natarajan envisioned a system that would be trained on specialized medical knowledge. Peer-reviewed research underpinning the AI model has been  accepted by the scientific journal Nature, Google said Wednesday.  This makes the company first to publish research detailing an AI model that answers medical questions in the journal, it said. The paper contains some surprising results. When the model was posed medical questions, a pool of clinicians rated its responses to be 92.6% in line with the scientific consensus, just shy of the 92.9% score that real-life medical professionals received, according to a statement from Nature, though the clinicians’ evaluations of Med-PaLM weren’t based on it being deployed in hospital settings with real-life patient variables. The study also found that just 5.8% of the model’s responses could cause harm, besting the 6.5% rate achieved by clinicians. Sarah West, managing director of AI Now Institute, a policy research center, said that while publishing in a scientific journal demonstrates some academic oversight of Google’s findings, it’s an insufficient standard for being ready to use the AI system in real health-care settings. “There's all kinds of information that you would want to know, in order to meaningfully evaluate a system before it's deployed into commercial use,” she said. “And you need to look at this system at the level of each hospital, if they're going to be doing any kind of customization of a system for a particular clinical setting.” Without any other mandates for independent testing or evaluation, “we're stuck in a situation where we have to rely on the company's words that they have adequately evaluated” the AI systems before deployment, West added. It’s still early days for Med-PaLM. The company has just in the past few months begun to open up the model to a select group of healthcare and life science organizations for testing, and the company says the model is still far from being ready for use in patient care. Google researchers who worked on the model say that in the future, Med-PaLM could have the potential to provide doctors an expert source to consult when encountering unfamiliar cases, help with the drudgery of clinical documentation and extend care to people who might otherwise not receive any form of health care at all. “Can we catalyze the medical AI community to think seriously about the potential of foundation models for health care?” said Karan Singhal, a software engineer who worked on the project. “That was our guiding North Star.” In March, Google   announced Med-PaLM’s second iteration, which it said reached an 86.5% score when answering US medical licensing-style questions — an improvement over its earlier 67% score. The first generation of Med-PaLM was evaluated by 9 clinicians from the UK, the US and India; 15 physicians assessed the second version, Google said. Google and OpenAI, the   Microsoft Corp.-backed startup, are locked in a fierce race in artificial intelligence, and the medical field is no exception. Medical systems have begun experimenting with OpenAI’s technology, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Google, for its part, has begun trying out Med-PaLM with the Mayo Clinic, according to the Journal. Both Karthikesalingam and Natarajan had long dreamed of bringing AI to health care. Having begun his career as a physician, Karthikesalingam found himself longing for an AI model that could complement his work. Natarajan grew up in parts of India where for many people seeing a doctor was not feasible.  One of the team’s first researchers, Tao Tu, said said he was initially skeptical of the team’s ambitious timetable. “I had an initial call with Vivek, and Vivek said we plan to print out a paper in a month,” Tu said. “And I was like, how is that possible? I have been publishing a number of papers for many years. I know nothing will happen in such a short timescale.” Yet the team pulled it off. After a five-week sprint that stretched over Thanksgiving and Christmas, which included 15-hour work days, the group had composed Med-PaLM, the first generation of the model, and announced it in December. Researchers said the rapid advances in the technology were what motivated them to move so quickly. Along the way, the team began to get a sense of the significance of what they were building. After some early tweaks, the model began achieving a 63% score on the medical licensing exam, clearing the threshold to pass. And in the early stages of the project, the model’s responses were easily distinguishable from the clinicians’ answers by Karthikesalingam, who is a practicing physician himself. But by the end of the process, he could no longer tell which was which, Singhal said. AI algorithms are already used in health care settings for specific tasks, such as in medical imaging, or to help predict which hospitalized patients are most at-risk for sepsis. But generative AI models pose new risks, which Google itself acknowledges. The models might, for instance, deliver medical misinformation in a convincing fashion or integrate biases that could augment existing health disparities.  In order to mitigate these risks, the Med-PaLM researchers said they incorporated “adversarial testing” into their AI model. They curated a list of questions designed to elicit AI-generated answers with the potential for harm and bias, including a set of questions focused on sensitive medical topics like Covid-19 and mental health, as well as another set of questions on health equity. The latter focused on issues like racial biases in health care.  Google said Med-PaLM 2 gave answers that were more frequently rated as having a “low risk of harm” compared to its first model. But it also said there wasn’t a significant change in the model’s ability to avoid generating inaccurate or irrelevant information.Shek Azizi, a senior research scientist at Google, said that during testing for Med-PaLM, when they asked the AI model to summarize a patient chart or respond with clinical information, they found Med-PaLM “may hallucinate and refer back to studies that are not basically there, or that weren’t provided.” Large language models’ propensity for putting out convincing but wrong answers raises concerns about their use in “domains where truth and veracity are paramount and, in this case, life or death issues,” said Meredith Whittaker, president of the Signal Foundation, which supports private messaging, and a former Google manager. She is also concerned about the prospect of “deploying this technology in settings where the incentives are already calibrated to reduce the amount of care and the amount of money spent on care for people who are suffering.” In a demonstration for Bloomberg reporters, Google showed off an experimental chatbot interface for Med-PaLM 2 in which a user could choose from a variety of medical issues to explore, including conditions like “incontinence,” “loss of balance,” and “acute pancreatitis.”  Selecting one of the conditions generated a description from the AI model along with evaluation results, with ratings for criteria like “reflects clinical and scientific consensus” and “correct recall of knowledge.” The interface also displayed a clinician’s real description of the issue to compare against the AI-generated answers. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google announced that it was exploring capabilities for Med-PaLM 2 to draw information from both images and text, allowing testers to help interpret information from X-rays and mammograms to someday improve patient outcomes. “Please provide a report to summarize the following chest X-ray,” read one prompt from the experimental Med-PaLM 2 interface seen by Bloomberg. Though it may not work as advertised in a real clinical setting, the AI’s response looked convincing and comprehensive. “The lung fields are clear without consolidation or edema, the mediastinum is otherwise unremarkable,” it said. “The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size, no effusion or pneumothorax is noted, no displaced fractures are evident.”\"]\n",

At a behind-closed-doors hearing in Brussels on Thursday, the social media platform will attempt to rebut EU claims its behavior was an illegal abuse of dominance, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The European Commission issued a so-called statement of objections against California-based Meta in December. While companies have a right to defend themselves, such filings can be followed by hefty fines as well orders to fix business models. EU watchdogs alleged that Meta imposed unfair trading terms that enable it to use data on competing online classified ad services for its Marketplace platform. They also pointed to how Meta made access to Facebook Marketplace conditional on having a Facebook social media account.  The commission declined to comment on the case ahead of Thursday’s hearing.  Meta pointed to a previous statement from Tim Lamb, the company’s top lawyer in Europe, saying the EU regulator’s claims “are without foundation” and that the it would “continue to work with regulatory authorities.”  Facebook Marketplace has also been targeted by other regulators, including Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which accepted a slate of concessions in May.  These include a pledge to allow advertisers to opt out of having their data used to improve the Facebook Marketplace. No such commitments have yet been accepted by the EU’s antitrust branch. The EU commission has been probing Facebook since 2019. The platform lost a case in May seeking to limit what information officials could collect. The EU’s second-highest court ruled that the company had failed to prove that the requests for details “went beyond what was necessary” or that EU measures taken since didn’t sufficiently protect sensitive data.  More recently, Meta found itself on the losing side of another EU court decision, in which the bloc’s Court of Justice backed a German antitrust order which targeted the US tech firm’s power to cash-in on a vast trove of users’ data.']\n",

      "['Turkey’s Papara became the country’s first fintech firm to reach unicorn status following a recent deal with Spain’s Beka Finance SV SA. Beka last week received an undisclosed amount of cash and shares in the Istanbul-based firm in exchange for the acquisition of Papara’s Spanish rival Rebellion, which offers mobile banking services such as money transfers, prepaid cards and cash-back. “When we gave Beka Finance our shares, they became our shareholders at a price level that valued our company at unicorn level,” Papara founder Ahmed Karsli said in a phone interview, referring to a tech startup with a valuation over $1 billion. Papara’s unicorn status is particularly significant after a global slump in valuations in global tech assets reached Turkey. Venture capitalists only invested about $111 million in Turkish assets during the first half of this year, according to data from startups.watch, an Istanbul-based industry monitoring group. This compares to the boom years of 2021 and 2022 when investments in Turkish startups reached $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.  Founded in 2016 as an electronic payments firm, Papara was growing only on its equity until Beka Finance joined as a partner, according to Birce Ciravoglu, Papara’s M&A and expansion director. This year, it expanded its product offerings beyond core banking services to include pet, home, travel and mobile insurance.  “Papara is the first fintech unicorn startup out of Turkey,” she said in a phone interview. “It has also become one of the leading fintech firms in Europe with 16 million active individual and corporate users,” she said. “I am so excited about this fact.” The company is in advanced negotiations to buy another European neobank, Ciravoglu said. “Then we can share with the public the exact amount of our valuation,” she said.  Google’s Bard artificial intelligence chatbot will answer a question about how many pandas live in zoos quickly, and with a surfeit of confidence.

The contractors are the invisible backend of the generative AI boom that’s hyped to change everything. Chatbots like Bard use computer intelligence to respond almost instantly to a range of queries spanning all of human knowledge and creativity. But to improve those responses so they can be reliably delivered again and again, tech companies rely on actual people who review the answers, provide feedback on mistakes and weed out any inklings of bias. It’s an increasingly thankless job. Six current Google contract workers said that as the company entered a AI arms race with rival OpenAI over the past year, the size of their workload and complexity of their tasks increased. Without specific expertise, they were trusted to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Documents shared with Bloomberg show convoluted instructions that workers must apply to tasks with deadlines for auditing answers that can be as short as three minutes. “As it stands right now, people are scared, stressed, underpaid, don’t know what’s going on,” said one of the contractors. “And that culture of fear is not conducive to getting the quality and the teamwork that you want out of all of us.” Google has positioned its AI products as public resources in health, education and everyday life. But privately and publicly, the contractors have raised concerns about their working conditions, which they say hurt the quality of what users see. One Google contract staffer who works for Appen said in a letter to Congress in May that the speed at which they are required to review content could lead to Bard becoming a “faulty” and “dangerous” product. Google has made AI a major priority across the company, rushing to infuse the new technology into its flagship products after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google opened up Bard to 180 countries and territories and unveiled experimental AI features in marquee products like search, email and Google Docs. Google positions itself as superior to the competition because of its access to “the breadth of the world’s knowledge.”  “We undertake extensive work to build our AI products responsibly, including rigorous testing, training, and feedback processes we’ve honed for years to emphasize factuality and reduce biases,” Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said in a statement. The company said it isn’t only relying on the raters to improve the AI, and that there are a number of other methods for improving its accuracy and quality. Read More:  Google’s Rush to Win in AI Led to Ethical Lapses, Employees Say To prepare for the public using these products, workers said they started getting AI-related tasks as far back as January. One trainer, employed by Appen, was recently asked to compare two answers providing information about the latest news on Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care, rating the responses by helpfulness and relevance. Workers are also frequently asked to determine whether the AI model’s answers contain verifiable evidence. Raters are asked to decide whether a response is helpful based on six-point guidelines that include analyzing answers for things like specificity, freshness of information and coherence.  They are also asked to make sure the responses don’t “contain harmful, offensive, or overly sexual content,” and don’t “contain inaccurate, deceptive, or misleading information.” Surveying the AI’s responses for misleading content should be “based on your current knowledge or quick web search,” the guidelines say. “You do not need to perform a rigorous fact check” when assessing the answers for helpfulness. The example answer to “Who is Michael Jackson?” included an inaccuracy about the singer starring in the movie “Moonwalker” — which the AI said was released in 1983. The movie actually came out in 1988. “While verifiably incorrect,” the guidelines state, “this fact is minor in the context of answering the question, ‘Who is Michael Jackson?’” Even if the inaccuracy seems small, “it is still troubling that the chatbot is getting main facts wrong,” said  Alex Hanna, the director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and a former Google AI ethicist. “It seems like that’s a recipe to exacerbate the way these tools will look like they’re giving details that are correct, but are not,” she said.  Raters say they are assessing high-stakes topics for Google’s AI products.  One of the examples in the instructions, for instance, talks about evidence that a rater could use to determine the right dosages for a medication to treat high blood pressure, called Lisinopril. Google said that some workers concerned about accuracy of content may not have been training specifically for accuracy, but for tone, presentation and other attributes it tests. “Ratings are deliberately performed on a sliding scale to get more precise feedback to improve these models,” the company said. “Such ratings don’t directly impact the output of our models and they are by no means the only way we promote accuracy.”  Read the contract staffers’ instructions for training Google’s generative AI here:   Ed Stackhouse, the Appen worker who sent the letter to Congress, said in an interview that contract staffers were being asked to do AI labeling work on Google’s products “because we’re indispensable to AI as far as this training.” But he and other workers said they appeared to be graded for their work in mysterious, automated ways. They have no way to communicate with Google directly, besides providing feedback in a “comments” entry on each individual task. And they have to move fast. “We’re getting flagged by a type of AI telling us not to take our time on the AI,” Stackhouse added. Google disputed the workers’ description of being automatically flagged by AI for exceeding time targets. At the same time, the company said that Appen is responsible for all performance reviews for employees. Appen did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Accenture said the company does not comment on client work. Other technology companies training AI products also hire human contractors to improve them. In January,  Time reported that laborers in Kenya, paid $2 an hour, had worked to make ChatGPT less toxic. Other tech giants, including Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. make use of subcontracted staff to moderate social network content and product reviews, and to provide technical support and customer service. “If you want to ask, what is the secret sauce of Bard and ChatGPT? It’s all of the internet. And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

      "['The absence of a foldable phone in Apple Inc.’s portfolio is creating an opening for rivals to overtake the iPhone maker, according to Honor Device Co.’s chief executive officer. The Shenzhen-based firm on Wednesday rolled out its latest foldable device, the Magic V2, which measures less than 10mm thick. The phone has a regular glass display comparable to the iPhone 14 Pro on its exterior and a 7.92-inch foldable OLED screen on the inside. The Magic V2 starts at 8,999 yuan ($1,254.5) in China, the same price as the iPhone 14 Pro Max. “The product has only one targeted competitor — Apple’s topmost flagship phones,” Honor CEO George Zhao said in an interview ahead of the unveiling. “As strong as Apple is, it can’t fulfill all demands from consumers.” Honor, once a sub-brand of Huawei Technologies Co., spun off from the telecom equipment provider in late 2020 after US sanctions choked off Huawei’s access to advanced chips. As an independent entity, Honor is not subject to the same curbs, and the Magic V2 is powered by Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon 5G chipset. The world’s major Android phone brands, from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp., have all introduced a variety of foldable models, leaving Apple the only top vendor without such an offering. Foldables took only a fraction of global smartphone shipments last year, but the potential is growing. Their larger screens are a selling point to help Android manufacturers ask higher prices and increase their typically paper-thin margins. More than 21 million foldable phones will be shipped this year and the category is on track to more than double by 2027, research firm IDC estimated. “Similar to the rise of electric cars, foldables have created a new arena in the smartphone industry,” Zhao said. Chinese smartphone consumers have long prioritized higher specifications and larger displays when making their purchase decision. Apple’s iPhone is one of the top-selling devices in the country, though the market is competitive enough for the leader in sales to change regularly. Honor was the only major brand that grew shipments in Covid-stricken China last year, defying a double-digit slump that delivered a decade low for the market. Smartphone makers are facing an even fiercer fight in 2023 as the cooling economy suppresses demand.  The company is mulling plans to sell the Magic V2 in overseas markets as well as in China, and Europe will be a key part of its expansion this year, said Zhao.']\n",

Now, the company will have to figure out how to fund the $32 billion of commitments it securedBloomberg Terminal in 2022 to help fund the deal.  “With this decision, the Commission recognizes the importance of this combination in enabling enterprises to accelerate growth and momentum in the multi-cloud ecosystem,” Broadcom said in a statementBloomberg Terminal on Wednesday.

Should Broadcom replace the debt with a bond offering, it would likely surpass Pfizer Inc.’s $31 billion transaction that helped fund the purchase of Seagen Inc. with the fourth-biggest US investment-grade bond sale ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Though Broadcom’s absolute debt may nearly double, the components of debt financing could include a fair amount of five-year or shorter bank terms loans — versus 100% longer-duration public debt — to lower borrowing costs and further hasten the potential pace of debt reduction,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffmanwrote in a June noteBloomberg Terminal.  Broadcom and VMWare didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Broadcom’s 4.926% bond due in 2037 rose over 1 cent on the dollar to about 90.4 cents as of 10:11 a.m. New York time, according to Trace data.

      "['      A US judge’s refusal to halt Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. is a blow to Sony Group Corp. It’s also a huge validation of Sony’s power and the central role its PlayStation console plays in the fate of Microsoft’s games business and the whole industry. Microsoft has argued the deal math doesn’t add up if you remove sales of Call of Duty on PlayStation, and the judge noted that the plan the Microsoft board signed off on relied on these sales. Additionally, the judge was persuaded by Microsoft’s argument that Call of Duty is like Minecraft where play across competing console platforms is key to retaining players. US regulators argued Microsoft’s  move to make some ZeniMax games exclusive to its console and Windows PCs after acquiring the game maker were proof of the company’s incentive to restrict access to Call of Duty. The simple fact is that, as consoles go, the PlayStation is simply too big to ignore for a huge, multiplayer game franchise. Acquiring Activision and halting PlayStation sales would burn a decent chunk of Microsoft’s $69 billion on Day One. If Call of Duty were to go the Halo route, another game — maybe from Electronic Arts Inc.’s Battlefield franchise — would take its place. So the PlayStation gets to keep Call of Duty. That’s good for Sony, right? Not necessarily. Sony has been lobbying heavily against the deal in multiple jurisdictions. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, in her ruling, gave a pretty strong analysis for why: “Before the merger, a consumer wanting to play a Call of Duty console game had to buy a PlayStation or an Xbox. After the merger, consumers can utilize the cloud to play on the device of choice, including, it is intended, on the Nintendo Switch. Perhaps bad for Sony. But good for Call of Duty gamers and future gamers.” This is not just potentially a loss for Sony. It’s a big loss for the Federal Trade Commission and its chair, Lina Khan. In the immediate aftermath of the judge’s decision, FTC officials were leaning toward filing an appeal, Bloomberg reported. Judge Corley had criticized the FTC for leaning so much on the perspective of Sony executive Jim Ryan for the agency’s argument. “The FTC’s heavy reliance on Mr. Ryan’s testimony is unpersuasive,” the judge wrote. “Sony opposes the merger; its opposition is understandable.” The ruling offered a pat on the head to the deal’s opponents. “Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox,” Corley wrote. It will surely come as cold comfort to Ryan and Khan.

Ensuring that the response is well-sourced and based on evidence, however, falls to thousands of outside contractors from companies including Appen Ltd. and Accenture Plc, who can make as little as $14 an hour and labor with minimal training under frenzied deadlines, according to several contractors, who declined to be named for fear of losing their jobs. The contractors are the invisible backend of the generative AI boom that’s hyped to change everything. Chatbots like Bard use computer intelligence to respond almost instantly to a range of queries spanning all of human knowledge and creativity. But to improve those responses so they can be reliably delivered again and again, tech companies rely on actual people who review the answers, provide feedback on mistakes and weed out any inklings of bias. It’s an increasingly thankless job. Six current Google contract workers said that as the company entered a AI arms race with rival OpenAI over the past year, the size of their workload and complexity of their tasks increased. Without specific expertise, they were trusted to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Documents shared with Bloomberg show convoluted instructions that workers must apply to tasks with deadlines for auditing answers that can be as short as three minutes. “As it stands right now, people are scared, stressed, underpaid, don’t know what’s going on,” said one of the contractors. “And that culture of fear is not conducive to getting the quality and the teamwork that you want out of all of us.” Google has positioned its AI products as public resources in health, education and everyday life. But privately and publicly, the contractors have raised concerns about their working conditions, which they say hurt the quality of what users see. One Google contract staffer who works for Appen said in a letter to Congress in May that the speed at which they are required to review content could lead to Bard becoming a “faulty” and “dangerous” product. Google has made AI a major priority across the company, rushing to infuse the new technology into its flagship products after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. In May, at the company’s annual I/O developers conference, Google opened up Bard to 180 countries and territories and unveiled experimental AI features in marquee products like search, email and Google Docs. Google positions itself as superior to the competition because of its access to “the breadth of the world’s knowledge.”  “We undertake extensive work to build our AI products responsibly, including rigorous testing, training, and feedback processes we’ve honed for years to emphasize factuality and reduce biases,” Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said in a statement. The company said it isn’t only relying on the raters to improve the AI, and that there are a number of other methods for improving its accuracy and quality. Read More:  Google’s Rush to Win in AI Led to Ethical Lapses, Employees Say To prepare for the public using these products, workers said they started getting AI-related tasks as far back as January. One trainer, employed by Appen, was recently asked to compare two answers providing information about the latest news on Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care, rating the responses by helpfulness and relevance. Workers are also frequently asked to determine whether the AI model’s answers contain verifiable evidence. Raters are asked to decide whether a response is helpful based on six-point guidelines that include analyzing answers for things like specificity, freshness of information and coherence.  They are also asked to make sure the responses don’t “contain harmful, offensive, or overly sexual content,” and don’t “contain inaccurate, deceptive, or misleading information.” Surveying the AI’s responses for misleading content should be “based on your current knowledge or quick web search,” the guidelines say. “You do not need to perform a rigorous fact check” when assessing the answers for helpfulness. The example answer to “Who is Michael Jackson?” included an inaccuracy about the singer starring in the movie “Moonwalker” — which the AI said was released in 1983. The movie actually came out in 1988. “While verifiably incorrect,” the guidelines state, “this fact is minor in the context of answering the question, ‘Who is Michael Jackson?’” Even if the inaccuracy seems small, “it is still troubling that the chatbot is getting main facts wrong,” said  Alex Hanna, the director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and a former Google AI ethicist. “It seems like that’s a recipe to exacerbate the way these tools will look like they’re giving details that are correct, but are not,” she said.  Raters say they are assessing high-stakes topics for Google’s AI products.  One of the examples in the instructions, for instance, talks about evidence that a rater could use to determine the right dosages for a medication to treat high blood pressure, called Lisinopril. Google said that some workers concerned about accuracy of content may not have been training specifically for accuracy, but for tone, presentation and other attributes it tests. “Ratings are deliberately performed on a sliding scale to get more precise feedback to improve these models,” the company said. “Such ratings don’t directly impact the output of our models and they are by no means the only way we promote accuracy.”  Read the contract staffers’ instructions for training Google’s generative AI here:   Ed Stackhouse, the Appen worker who sent the letter to Congress, said in an interview that contract staffers were being asked to do AI labeling work on Google’s products “because we’re indispensable to AI as far as this training.” But he and other workers said they appeared to be graded for their work in mysterious, automated ways. They have no way to communicate with Google directly, besides providing feedback in a “comments” entry on each individual task. And they have to move fast. “We’re getting flagged by a type of AI telling us not to take our time on the AI,” Stackhouse added. Google disputed the workers’ description of being automatically flagged by AI for exceeding time targets. At the same time, the company said that Appen is responsible for all performance reviews for employees. Appen did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Accenture said the company does not comment on client work. Other technology companies training AI products also hire human contractors to improve them. In January,  Time reported that laborers in Kenya, paid $2 an hour, had worked to make ChatGPT less toxic. Other tech giants, including Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. make use of subcontracted staff to moderate social network content and product reviews, and to provide technical support and customer service. “If you want to ask, what is the secret sauce of Bard and ChatGPT? It’s all of the internet. And it’s all of this labeled data that these labelers create,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University. “It’s worth remembering that these systems are not the work of magicians — they are the work of thousands of people and their low-paid labor.” Google said in a statement that it “is simply not the employer of any of these workers. Our suppliers, as the employers, determine their working conditions, including pay and benefits, hours and tasks assigned, and employment changes – not Google.” Staffers said they had encountered bestiality, war footage, child pornography and hate speech as part of their routine work assessing the quality of Google products and services. While some workers, like those reporting to Accenture, do have health care benefits, most only have minimal “counseling service” options that allow workers to phone a hotline for mental health advice, according to an internal website explaining some contractor benefits. For Google’s Bard project, Accenture workers were asked to write creative responses for the AI chatbot, employees said. They answered prompts on the chatbot — one day they could be writing a poem about dragons in Shakespearean style, for instance, and another day they could be debugging computer programming code. Their job was to file as many creative responses to the prompts as possible each work day, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to discuss internal processes. For a short period, the workers were reassigned to review obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. After one worker filed an HR complaint with Accenture, the project was abruptly terminated for the US team, though some of the writers’ counterparts in Manila continued to work on Bard. The jobs have little security. Last month, half a dozen Google contract staffers working for Appen received a note from management, saying their positions had been eliminated “due to business conditions.” The firings felt abrupt, the workers said, because they had just received several emails offering them bonuses to work longer hours training AI products. The six fired workers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board in June. They alleged they were illegally terminated for  organizing, because of Stackhouse’s letter to Congress.  Before the end of the month, they were reinstated to their jobs. Google said the dispute was a matter between the workers and Appen, and that they “respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union.” Appen didn’t respond to questions about its workers organizing. The Alphabet Workers Union — which has organized both Google employees and contract staffers, including those at Appen and Accenture — said it condemned how the new workloads around AI made job conditions for workers even more difficult. Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, said the work of these contract staffers at Google and other technology platforms is “a labor exploitation story,” pointing to their precarious job security and how some of these kinds of workers are paid well below a living wage. “Playing with one of these systems, and saying you’re doing it just for fun — maybe it feels less fun, if you think about what it’s taken to create and the human impact of that,” Bender said.  The contract staffers said they have never received any direct communication from Google about their new AI-related work — it all gets filtered through their employer. They said they don’t know where the AI-generated responses they see are coming from, nor where their feedback goes. In the absence of this information, and with the ever-changing nature of their jobs, workers worry that they’re helping to create a bad product.  Some of the answers they encounter can be bizarre. In response to the prompt, “Suggest the best words I can make with the letters: k, e, g, a, o, g, w,” one answer generated by the AI listed 43 possible words, starting with suggestion No. 1: “wagon.” Suggestions 2 through 43, meanwhile, repeated the word “WOKE” over and over.  In another task, a rater was presented with a lengthy answer that began with, “As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.” That response is associated with OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-4. Though Google said that Bard “is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT,” raters have wondered why such phrasing appears in their tasks. Bender said it makes little sense for large tech corporations to be encouraging people to ask an AI chatbot questions on such a broad range of topics, and to be presenting them as “everything machines.” “Why should the same machine that is able to give you the weather forecast in Florida also be able to give you advice about medication doses?” she asked. “The people behind the machine who are tasked with making it be somewhat less terrible in some of those circumstances have an impossible job.”']\n",

Temasek Holdings Pte-owned PSA put the stake sale on hold after potential valuations were lower than expected, as shipping activity globally has slowed, the people said. PSA had sought about $4 billion for its 20% share of CK Hutchison’s ports assets, Bloomberg News reported. The company would revisit a stake sale once trading in ports rebounds, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. A representative for PSA declined to comment. Shares of Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, the Singapore-listed business trust affiliated with Hutchison Port Holdings Ltd., rose as much as 1% on Thursday. Chinese state-owned conglomerates China Merchants Group and China Cosco Shipping Corp. had been among the firms expressing interest in acquiring the stake, people familiar with the matter have said. Lower disposable incomes, new ship deliveries and recession headwinds could lead to further softness in the container-shipping industry’s fundamentals in the second half of 2023, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephane Kovatchev. Freight rates — a key driver of profitability in the sector — have dropped by about 85% in the past 22 months, he wrote in a noteBloomberg Terminal on Tuesday.

Hutchison Port Holdings is one of the world’s biggest port services providers, with a network spanning Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australasia, its website shows. Based in Singapore, PSA operates more than 60 deep-sea, rail and inland terminals across 42 countries, according to its website.

      "['US prosecutors and IRS agents are deploying undercover agents and closely examining records to build criminal and civil cases against wealthy individuals suspected of illegally taking advantage of tax breaks offered by Puerto Rico. The cash-strapped island used eye-popping incentives to lure hedge fund managers, cryptocurrency traders and other Americans to the US territory over the last decade. But investigators are now focusing on whether people lied about how much time they spend on the island and the source of their income, according to people familiar with the matter. US officials are also looking at the promoters, attorneys and accountants who marketed the tax program, one of the people familiar with the probes said. At least two criminal investigations, including one involving a US lawyer, could result in charges soon, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the probes aren’t public.  Prosecutors are weighing conspiracy and wire fraud charges, according to a speaker at a New York conference last month who recounted a phone call with a federal prosecutor who had been to San Juan. “He said, ‘Look, we’re here, we are looking to make cases,”’ said the speaker, attorney Carlos Ortiz. “‘We’re here with IRS agents, we’re working with officials from Puerto Rico.”’  “The message is the noose is tightening,” Ortiz said after recounting the conversation. The controversial tax breaks are designed to bring wealthy Americans to a US territory fresh out of bankruptcy and where more than 40% of residents live in poverty after hurricanes ravaged the infrastructure and medical system. Since 2012, more than 5,000 Americans have qualified for incentives that allow them to legally avoid paying federal income tax and no taxes at all on dividend, interest and capital gains income. Another 3,600 businesses avoid taxes on dividends from earnings and profits, and pay 4% tax on export services. But lawyers familiar with the program said the residency requirements are rigorous and tempt people to cheat. To qualify, people must stay on the island at least 183 days a year. They also must show they have a “closer connection” to Puerto Rico than the US, and that the island is their “tax home.” Internal Revenue Service investigations may start with a taxpayer’s Form 8898, which must be filled out to begin or end “bona fide residence” in Puerto Rico or other US territories such as Guam or American Samoa.  Questions include: How many days were you present in the territory and the U.S.? Where was your principal permanent home? Where was your automobile located? Where were you registered to vote? Where did you derive the majority of your income? Any new cases would be the first since Gabriel F. Hernandez, an accountant at BDO Puerto Rico, was indicted on wire fraud charges in October 2020. Prosecutors accused him of offering to help an undercover IRS agent falsely claim he earned $500,000 on the island. Hernandez pleaded not guilty, and his case is pending. A lawyer for Hernandez couldn’t be reached to comment. The IRS said in a statement that it investigates potential criminal violations when warranted. The Justice Department declined to comment.   Residency investigations are not new to wealthy people with multiple homes. Tax authorities in New York City, New York state and California have long sought to determine where people should be paying taxes. The potential savings in Puerto Rico have drawn hundreds of crypto investors like Michael Terpin, who came several years ago. “I didn’t want to pay capital gains tax to the IRS on my Bitcoin,” Terpin said in May at a crypto conference in Miami. Puerto Rico is “the only place that you can go and not have to pay on your global tax without renouncing” US citizenship, he said. In an interview, Terpin said: “I’ve been told that every single person is going to get audited, and that’s fine. I keep incredibly precise notes. I get them run past both a tax lawyer and a CPA, and I’ve got two bookkeepers. So bring it on, I’m not afraid of an audit.” Puerto Rico attorneys like Giovanni Mendez said that sort of attention to detail may convince the IRS that someone deserves the tax breaks. “In practical terms, they have to have feet on the ground,” Mendez said. “They have to have a home available to them at all times.  They can’t just stay in hotels or lease out a home when they’re here.” The IRS Large Business and International Division announced a campaign in January 2021 to identify those who “may be erroneously reporting US source income as Puerto Rico source income in order to avoid US taxation,” according to the agency’s website.  The program is also under attack from local residents who believe that wealthy Americans are driving up real estate prices and paying far less in taxes than native Puerto Ricans. Amid sporadic protests against the wave of low-tax “colonizers,” local legislation is pending that would overhaul the incentives. “It has been 10 years since the law was approved and we want to know what has it resulted in,” said Marlyn Goyco-Garcia, the national organizing manager for the Center for Popular Democracy, which has been lobbying to have the incentives modified or eliminated. “Especially in this time of crisis where everyone is paying more for electricity, health, education.” Popular Democracy is pressing the IRS for information on the investigations and Goyco-Garcia said the agency offered to provide more details in August. Terpin, however, says the tax breaks have lured world class money managers and entrepreneurs to the territory. “For some reason, that’s seen as a bad thing by some people,” he said. The program began with the Puerto Rican Export Services Act, or Act 20, and the Individual Investors Act, or Act 22. They were consolidated in 2020 through Act 60, which required exempt businesses to generate $3 million in revenue and employ at least one Puerto Rican resident. Individuals must buy a home on the island and donate at least $10,000 a year to charities. Private equity investor Robb Rill formed the 20/22 Act Society to navigate the legal and tax questions for people considering the move. A spokesman for the society said the “information document requests” the IRS is making to taxpayers are “onerous in nature.” The case of Hernandez, the indicted accountant, “raised awareness of potential risks associated with non-compliance and highlighted the importance of adhering to the legal requirements and maintaining accurate documentation,” according to the 20/22 society spokesman. That kind of information is critical during audits, said tax attorney Mark Leeds, who has represented 30 clients relocating to Puerto Rico over the past decade. “If they’re making $1 million or more, they should expect to be audited,” Leeds said. “If an audit comes, they want to have their presence locked down with a diary. I tell them to buy something every day with a credit card. Of course, these days cell and GPS tracking can also be used to determine an individual’s whereabouts.”   ']\n",

      "['SBI Holdings Inc., Rakuten Group Inc. and Monex Group Inc. are among brokerages in Japan that sold Credit Suisse’s riskiest bonds to retail investors, highlighting the widening fallout of these products in the country. The operators of the nation’s three major online brokerages offered the Swiss lender’s Additional Tier 1 notes for a minimum purchase amount of $200,000, according to their documents seen by Bloomberg News. The materials obtained also raised questions over whether information over the risks associated with the product was properly disclosed to investors. Switzerland’s decision in March to write down the bonds as part of a government-led rescue of Credit Suisse shocked investors in Japan, who boughtBloomberg Terminal around 140 billion yen ($1 billion) worth of the debt. Clients of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.’s securities venture with Morgan Stanley took the lion share of the hit. The debacle in a country that’s trying to push its citizens to invest more has prompted regulators to look into whether the firms properly explained the risks before selling the bonds.  “In consideration of the product characteristics of AT1 bonds of Credit Suisse Group AG, we have sold those securities to customers to whom we thought the products would be suited, after having sales staff explain about them in person,” an SBI spokesperson said by email, in response to questions about the documents.  Rakuten Securities Inc. sold the debt through its business partners called independent financial advisers and is “reviewing and inspecting” its sales practices and explanatory materials, a spokesperson said by email. The firm will “continue to follow up” with the buyers and “appropriately respond” should they decide to escalate the issue, she said.  A Monex spokesperson declined to comment on the sales. Call Them AT1s or CoCos, Here’s Why They Can Blow Up: QuickTake Credit Suisse AT1 Holder Losses Total $1 Billion in Japan  MUFG Clients Lost $700 Million in Credit Suisse AT1 Wipeout Credit Suisse AT1 Holders Force Finma to Share Wipeout Logic  The three firms declined to disclose the volume of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds they’ve sold. They also didn’t comment on whether they had explained so-called viability event provisions to clients verbally or in writing.   In the foreign securities information brochures, bond summaries, and pre-contract documents prepared in Japanese for buyers by SBI, Rakuten or Monex — obtained and reviewed by Bloomberg News — there is no mention that one of the debt’s features is it would be fully written down if “viability” events happen. Those events include extraordinary support from the public sector, based on the bond’s English prospectus. Swiss officials used that provision in proceeding with the wipe out on the Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders, as they engineered a rescue by UBS Group AG.  Monex and Rakuten’s foreign securities information and bond summaries state that the bond’s principal would be “reduced” should Credit Suisse’s common equity tier 1 ratio — a measure of financial strength — falls below 7%. SBI’s documents say the entire principal would be lost if the ratio falls below 7% or if authorities determined Credit Suisse has no chance of surviving.  In April, the lobby group representing Japanese brokerages urgedBloomberg Terminal members to clearly explain complex products to customers, in the aftermath of news about the Credit Suisse AT1 bond sales in the country.  Japan’s Financial Services Agency, which is following up on this issue, wants the brokerages involved to give thorough explanations to clients affected and carefully deal with any complaints, an official from the financial regulator told Bloomberg News in April. Brokerages may also need to check whether their sales processes were proper, according to the official. ']\n",

      "['Nvidia Corp. is in talks to join a list of investors in anchoring an initial public offering of Arm Ltd., the chip designer backed by SoftBank Group Corp., according to people familiar with the discussions. The group of IPO backers won’t be finalized until the offering gets underway in the fall, and the parties aren’t currently close to a formal agreement, said the people, who asked not be identified because the deliberations are private. The final list of anchor companies is likely to number five or six, one of the people said. The Financial Times previously reported that Nvidia was seeking to invest at a valuation of $35 billion to $40 billion, lower than the $80 billion that SoftBank wants. Representative for Nvidia and Arm declined to comment. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, is a longtime partner and client of Arm — and tried to acquire it in a deal that unraveled last year. SoftBank embarked on plans for an Arm IPO in the wake of that failed transaction. Bloomberg reported earlier that Arm was in talks with possible strategic investors — including Nvidia competitor Intel Corp. — to participate in what would be the year’s biggest initial stock sale. Bringing in anchor investors can help drum up interest and momentum for an IPO, especially given the elevated valuation that SoftBank is seeking. Arm’s success is critical for the Tokyo-based investment firm — which bought Arm for $32 billion in 2016 — to regain its footing after losing billions of dollars on startup investments. Read More: Arm Chief Pitches Chip Designer as AI Play in Buildup to IPO Nvidia, whose chips are vital to powering artificial intelligence, walked away from its proposed $40 billion deal to acquire Arm after hitting opposition from regulators and customers. The plan, which was proposed in 2020, collapsed after a lawsuit by the US Federal Trade Commission. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has said he hopes the Arm IPO can be the largest ever by a chip company. Arm’s valuation still hasn’t been set, and the company could be valued anywhere from $30 billion to $70 billion, Bloomberg News previously reported. Shares of SoftBank erased earlier losses on Wednesday, rising more than 2% in Tokyo. Arm is looking to raise as much as $10 billion in a New York listing later this year, after rejecting appeals from UK prime ministers to return to London, where it once traded. The firm’s tech is found in most of the world’s smartphones and is pervasive across the electronics industry. SoftBank executives have been pitching lofty valuations on the chip designer by presenting it as an artificial intelligence investment because its technology supports AI infrastructure. Anchor investors buying $100 million to $200 million worth of shares are increasingly popular for semiconductor-related IPOs. Growth equity firm General Atlantic invested about $100 million in Intel-backed Mobileye Global Inc.’s IPO last year, while Qualcomm Inc. backed GlobalFoundries Inc.’s listing in 2021.']\n",

Urs Hölzle joined the company, now the key unit of parent Alphabet Inc., in 1999 as its eighth employee, and will now transition into a role as a Google Fellow, the company said. In Google’s early years, Hölzle was instrumental in building the unique computing machinery that supported its major services, letting the company expand quickly from search into mapping, video and countless other fields. Eventually, Google would package that computing infrastructure as the core selling point of its cloud division. More recently, Hölzle led Google’s push into making its own chips for processing artificial intelligence, although the company has struggling to sell that hardware via cloud services. Hölzle is one of the last remaining Google employees that worked closely with company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who stepped down from their roles in 2019. The founders remain majority shareholders. CNBC earlier reported that Hölzle would become an “individual contributor” after more than two decades of leading technical teams, citing an internal email from Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian. The veteran will focus on articulating technical AI processes, facilitating discussions, and streamlining decision making, according to the memo. Hölzle previously sparked internal controversy when he moved to New Zealand in 2021, after opposing remote working for other employees during the pandemic. His new role adds to a series of changes at Google in recent weeks, including the departure of key artificial intelligence researcher Llion Jones.

      "['Scroll through TikTok in Taiwan, and you’ll find a rolling stream of videos covering the heated campaign for next January’s presidential election.  That’s making the island the next battleground in the war over political disinformation and the debate over whether China’s government can manipulate the popular app to its advantage — a concern shared in Washington ahead of the 2024 US election. TikTok isn’t the most used social media platform on the island — Facebook and YouTube have more daily visitors — and disinformation cuts across social media apps. But TikTok’s Chinese ownership and its status as the fastest-growing app is drawing scrutiny as campaigning gets underway.   “The risk level of disinformation on a platform comes from its popularity, and for TikTok, that’s only growing,” said Billion Lee, co-founder of the Taiwanese fact-checking platform Cofacts. Sensing a potential threat, authorities in Taiwan already barred TikTok from government-issued devices, in line with moves by countries including the US. Now they are weighing national security and free speech concerns before deciding whether to go further.  In a statement to Bloomberg, the company said it complies with laws and regulations wherever it works and has policies to combat disinformation and “prevent misuse of the platform.”  “We are proactively reaching out to the relevant government agencies to share how TikTok protects user data and counters misinformation,” according to the statement. That includes “confirming the authenticity of accounts of political figures and parties with the relevant individuals and organizations.” The stakes are high heading into next year’s vote. US-China tensions have soared the past year, with Taiwan often at the center of those strains. Whoever wins could help influence how that relationship evolves in the years ahead.  Why Taiwan’s 2024 Election Matters From China to US: QuickTake Given its importance to China and its ties to the US, Taiwan “has long been used as a testing ground for disinformation,” said Robin Lee, project manager of the fact-checking platform MyGoPen.  Tsai Ming-yen, the head of Taiwan’s national security bureau, said this month that his agency reviewed more than 1,800 cases of online disinformation and disputed information across several platforms, including Facebook and YouTube. He said that was 1,400 more than the same period last year and that he expected those figures to keep rising.  After TikTok was banned from government devices, some officials argued it should be barred from the island entirely, but that appears to be a minority view for now.  “Taiwan must be very cautious when we make this decision,” said Lo Ping-cheng, the minister in charge of the government’s internal discussions on regulating TikTok. “There is no timetable set for a decision so far.” TikTok has already proven itself an influential platform in major elections. In Malaysia last year, conservative religious parties used the app to attract younger voters who helped them score some key upsets. On the other end of the political spectrum, Thailand’s progressive Move Forward party outperformed pre-election polls in May, in part through more effective use of the app.  Read More: French Lawmakers Give TikTok Six Months to Fix Security ConcernsBloomberg Terminal In the US and Europe, TikTok faces an existential crisis over worries that its feed can be manipulated for political purposes and that user data can be accessed by its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on behalf of the Chinese government.  The company has repeatedly denied it receives data requests from Beijing. In its statement to Bloomberg, it added that “Taiwanese user data is stored in the U.S., Singapore and Malaysia.”  With campaigning in Taiwan underway, one viral video, which garnered almost 900,000 views, highlights the challenge authorities face. The clip accused Vice President Lai Ching-te — the ruling party’s presidential candidate — of risking citizens’ lives in a potential war with China, while alleging his children would be protected because they live in the US and are American citizens. The party has repeatedly said the clip is false.  “Taiwanese people, it’s time to wake up,” the narrator says on the video, hosted on an account run by a 32-year-old Taiwanese engineer who posts under the pseudonym “Citizen V.” That’s a nod to the film V for Vendetta and its message of protesting political tyranny.  The clip was flagged in May by contributors at Cofacts for containing misinformation. After that designation, it was taken down, but by then it had circulated for more than a month. Officials are concerned a rising tide of misleading information will confound the ability of organizations and the government to stop them all.  Cofacts and MyGoPen are part of a constellation of non-profits focused on disinformation who say they are funded by individual donations and foundations, separate from any political party or group.  In an interview, “Citizen V” — who asked not to be identified by his real name — said he was frustrated that his video was singled out. He said he doesn’t see himself as peddling in disinformation but he does want to be an influencer in the election. And he found TikTok to be the best venue for getting his posts — many in support of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People’s Party — to a wider audience. Now the blogger has more than 48,000 followers and about 18 million views in the past two months on TikTok.   Citizen V’s case highlights the difficulty in separating heated rhetoric and misleading claims — part of elections everywhere — from state-sponsored disinformation.  Officials in Taipei have been warning since March about “large-scale” operations from China that seek to interfere with the election, an issue the government has long experience with. Taiwanese agencies faced a record number of cyberattacks after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited in August. Between Pelosi’s trip and local elections last November, the Taipei-based organization Doublethink Lab recorded nearly 3,000 instances of targeted disinformation.  “The most common tactic by China is to create greater confrontation between the major parties,” said Puma Shen, chairperson of Doublethink Lab, which tracks online disinformation. “Their main purpose is to undermine trust in Taiwan.” And while false information is prevalent across Taiwanese social media, usage of TikTok significantly impacts whether people in Taiwan view China positively or negatively, said Shen.  In a report on its website, TikTok said that last year it discovered an influence network of inauthentic accounts operating from Taiwan that primarily targeted Taiwanese audiences to “create a high number of derogatory comments in addition to sharing content in Traditional Chinese targeting civic discourse in Taiwan.” The network had amassed more than 60,000 followers before it was discovered internally and removed, the report said. Another combative and popular political TikTok account is “Taiwan Strait Number One Brother,” which posts videos promoting China’s People’s Liberation Army and criticizing the US. The majority of its nearly 700 posts are dubbed or subtitled in simplified Chinese, rather than the traditional form commonly used in Taiwan — a sign security experts say signals the content may be generated in China.  A person involved in managing the account declined to comment beyond saying that they were based outside of Taiwan.  Cybersecurity experts say it’s not easy to identify whether TikTok accounts are run by real-life political supporters or backed by a state, but the threat of election-related disinformation campaigns will only grow. “We’re seeing more conspiracy-type information that is a lot harder to fight back on,” said Robin Lee, project manager at MyGoPen. “A potential invasion sounds very scary, but is also something that could happen in the future — that you cannot actually fact-check.” ']\n",

      "['BT Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Philip Jansen is leaving, capping four years of tangling with rivals, staff and an inexorable slide in the UK phone company’s share price. Jansen made the announcement this week without a clear next step or named successor, committing to going sometime in the next 12 months. The announcement followed years of attempts to overhaul the heavily regulated, 177-year-old former state monopoly.  Read More: BT CEO Philip Jansen to Step Down in Next 12 Months The 56-year-old executive — who was previously co-head of Worldpay Inc. and made £50 million ($64.5 million) in the payment processor’s initial public offering, according to media reportsBloomberg Terminal at the time — is now weighing his options. Meanwhile, he’s maintained a role as a senior adviser at private equity giant and former Worldpay investor Bain Capital. Jansen declined to be interviewed for this article. A representative for BT declined to comment.  BT’s share price has fallen almost 50% since the start of Jansen’s tenure. Investors have been turned off by eroding cash flow, a shrinking dividend, higher energy prices, and a worsening economy.  Running any European telecommunications company is tough right now. The businesses require billions of dollars in network upgrades to handle a growing demand for streaming video and music, connected devices and high-speed Internet access. On top of that, they’re closely regulated to promote competition and widespread network coverage, leading a number of European CEOs to complain that it’s too difficult to turn a profit.  UK-based mobile carrier Vodafone Group Plc and Spanish telecom infrastructure company Cellnex Telecom SA have also replaced their CEOs this year.  Read More: Big Tech is Forcing Carriers To Invest in Networks: Orange CEO BT is even more closely regulated than most. Despite pressure to break up, the UK carrier held on to its nationwide fixed network by separating it into a division called Openreach. Now private equity-backed upstarts called “alt nets” are laying down their own fiber and eating away at BT’s dominance. Jansen’s friend and predecessor at BT, Gavin Patterson, called the job “brutal,” following his own bruisingBloomberg Terminal relationship with the regulator and stock market.  “My resting heartbeat has gone down 5 or 6 points since I stopped,” Patterson said on a 2019 podcast with communications consulting firm Jericho Chambers a few weeks after Jansen took over. “His has gone up four.”  Joining BT in 2019, Jansen made building a high-speed fiber-optic network his priority. He slashed the dividend and diverted funds into the project. The company has pledged to spend £15 billion on fiber by 2026. But rivals rankled at the prospect of BT asserting a new fiber dominance. They’ve accused the company of using its pricing heft to undermine competition, complaining to regulators and renewing old calls to break up the company.  Read More: BT CEO Confronts the Reality of Boris Johnson’s Fiber Ambitions Three months into the job, Jansen also announced a share grant worth as much as £50 million a year to motivate workers. But any goodwill evaporated by 2022 when inflation soared ahead of pay increases and staff held their biggest strikes since 1987, hitting earnings and landing the previously unknown Jansen on placards. In June 2022, the front page of the Daily Mirror tabloid accused Jansen of being a “fat cat.” His £3.3 million pay packet in fiscal 2023 was nonetheless a downgrade from the generous share-based package he received as co-CEO role at Worldpay. Jansen also bought millions of BT shares, most of which are trading at a loss.  In May, Jansen announced a restructuring plan which could see the company’s workforce shrink by as much as 55,000 by the end of the decade, prompting fresh alarm from one of its unions. Ultimately the problems may go beyond what Jansen could have solved, Berenberg analyst Carl Murdock-Smith said by phone.  “There’s a genuine question of whether infrastructure telecoms investments fit public markets” given the length of payback, Murdock-Smith said.  BT is now worth about £12 billion - less than it paid for mobile carrier EE in 2016 - stoking talk about the company as a potential takeover target. Billionaire French telecom investor Patrick Drahi has built a 24.5% position in the last two years, though in May he committed to not mounting a takeover offer for six months. Tim Hoettges — the CEO of BT’s second-biggest investor Deutsche Telekom AG — told the Financial Times in February that buying a stake in BT was his “biggest mistake,” but said he’ll get his money back and “there will be a time when we will do a deal.” Read More: Billionaire Drahi Soon Gets a Fresh Shot at BT. Will He Take It? Whoever leads the heavily regulated former state monopoly next eventually seems doomed to trip at least one wire while navigating demands from government, more than 30 million customers, a unionized workforce, shareholders, one of Britain’s biggest private pension funds, and the board.']\n",

      "['There are growing signs the tide is turning for Chinese technology shares after a years-long crackdown that wiped out as much as three quarters of their market value. A gauge of mainland tech stocks listed in Hong Kong advanced for a third day following rare praiseBloomberg Terminal from the nation’s top economic planner, and news that government officials had met with six of the largest companies in the sector last week. The National Development and Reform Commission in a statement Wednesday commended enterprises such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., Meituan and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. for supporting the nation’s technological innovation with increased investment. That was after regulators last week levied fines on fintech arms backed by Tencent and Alibaba, a move seen as marking the end of the official clampdown.  The reform commission’s praise of tech platforms “helped aid the overall sentiment,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. The rally is also “probably just a carry over from the positive sentiment over the weekend of Ant and Tenpay’s fines,” he said.  The recent developments are being taken as a sign Beijing is finally switching to a more supportive stance toward the private sector after the crackdown that also caught up areas such as gaming and education. The suspension of Ant’s public listing in November 2020 was deemed as the start of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to rein in the technology sector. That overhang was finally removed when regulators imposed fines of more than $1 billion in fines on Ant Group and Tencent last week. Hang Seng Tech Index constituents have lost a combined $2 trillion in market capitalization since the gauge topped out in February 2021. The index outperformed the broader market between October and January amid reopening optimism, before sluggish macro economic data derailed its recovery. The best-performing stocks Wednesday included video-streaming-platform operator Bilibili Inc., which jumped as much as 9.2%, and Kuaishou Technology, which gained as much as 5.8%. The Hang Seng Tech Index rose 2%, but is still down more than 60% from its high in February 2021. Whether the current rally is sustainable remains uncertain, as many investors remain skeptical that Beijing has really changed its long-term view of the sector, according to analysts.  “A short-term relief rally is reasonable, but sustainability matters,” said Willer Chen, a senior research analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, citing longer-term concerns such as negative sentiment toward the Chinese economy. “It’s tough to make a guess on how long it will last.”']\n",

      "['Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was among the US officials whose emails were breached in a hack of government accounts that Microsoft Corp. has said originated from China, according to a person familiar with the matter. Raimondo has been a prominent American figure implementing export curbs on advanced semiconductor technology to China, moves which Beijing has decried as undermining free trade and global supply chain stability. The person asked not to be identified discussing information that hasn’t been made public. A Commerce Department spokesperson declined to comment or confirm the breach of Raimondo’s emails, which was reported earlier by the Washington Post. Microsoft also declined to comment late Wednesday night.   The Commerce and State Departments as well as agencies in Western Europe were also attacked, according to government officials and Microsoft.  Commerce took immediate action after being notified by Microsoft that the department had been breached, the spokesperson said earlier Wednesday. When asked on Thursday about the claims that US officials were hacked, China’s Foreign Ministry said that “the US should account for its cyberattacks as soon as possible rather than spread false information and divert attention.” When a Huawei Bid Turned Into a Hunt for a Corporate Mole Last month, the US State Department identified anomalous activity and alerted Microsoft to the attack, according to a spokesperson, who said the agency had no reason to doubt that the hackers, who breached Microsoft Outlook accounts, were based in China.  “A subsequent investigation by the company determined that the hackers accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data from a small number of accounts,” according to a statement from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA. It wasn’t known what other US agencies were affected, but a senior official said the number was in the single digits. Hacking Campaign Raises Fears China is Prepping for Conflict (1) US officials described the attacks as targeted and focused on a small number of accounts at the agencies that were breached, as opposed to hack seeking to steal large amounts of data. CISA and the FBI issued a joint advisory urging organizations to harden their Microsoft 365 cloud environments. The hacking campaign got underway in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Beijing to meet with top officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to the officials. In a blog post published Tuesday night, Microsoft described the group behind the attack as China-based, calling it Storm-0558. The hackers were able to remain undetected for a month after gaining access to email data from around 25 organizations in mid-May. “We assess this adversary is focused on espionage, such as gaining access to email systems for intelligence collection,” Charlie Bell, an executive vice president at Microsoft, wrote in another post. It also wasn’t clear which European governments were affected. Italian cybersecurity officials said they were in contact with Microsoft “in order to identify potential Italian subjects involved in the latest attacks.” Asked about the findings, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a regular briefing on Wednesday, accused the US of being the world’s largest cyberattacker. The hackers used “forged authentication tokens to access user email using an acquired Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key,” Microsoft’s Bell said in his post. The hackers were then able to access Outlook email hosted on systems run and operated by Microsoft. But how hackers obtained the signing key that gave them access to these emails remains unknown. “The big question here really is where did they get the MSA-key to sign tokens,” said Sami Laiho, a computer security expert who specializes in Microsoft products. One possible explanation, Laiho said, is if Microsoft itself was breached. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about how hackers obtained the signing key. The senior official used the news of the breach to highlight a source of tension between Microsoft and the US government: logging. Logs allow cybersecurity investigators to dig through digital clues left behind on their own systems to figure out if they’ve been hacked and who may be responsible. More advanced logging can capture and record granular actions made by a user, like if a certain email was accessed. At issue is whether Microsoft should sell logging as a premium add-on for government customers or include it in its product for free. A lack of logging complicated the investigation into the so-called SolarWinds attack, which was disclosed in 2020. In that episode, Russian state-sponsored hackers installed a malicious update in software made by SolarWinds Corp., which installed a digital backdoor which they could then use to further infiltrate SolarWinds customers. Ultimately, nine US agencies about 100 companies were breached via the SolarWinds update and other methods. Microsoft offered its premium logging feature for free for about a year in the wake of the SolarWinds hack. CISA and others have said that logs should be free, maintaining that they are crucial for detecting and investigating security incidents. On Wednesday, the senior officials said some of the affected US agencies paid for a premium logging feature and were able to detect the breach on their own. Microsoft, which retains the logs, was able to identify others who were hacked but don’t pay for logging. Requiring organizations to pay for better logging is a recipe for inadequate visibility into what has occurred in networks, the official said, adding that the issue requires urgent attention.']\n",

      "['Sony Group Corp. shares fell as much as 2.7% Wednesday in Tokyo after a US federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc. The Tokyo-based PlayStation maker has been the most vocal opponent of the deal, arguing that it would give Microsoft excessive market power by letting it control the lucrative Call of Duty franchise. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has said it intends to keep the game on Sony’s platform, pointing to its competitor’s much bigger share of the console market. US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco ruled in favor of Microsoft Tuesday, finding the US Federal Trade Commission didn’t prove the combination with Activision would harm competition for gaming. She extended a temporary restraining order that blocks Microsoft from closing the deal until midnight US West Coast time on Friday. The FTC is leaning toward appealing the decision, Bloomberg News reported. Sony did not respond to a request for comment. Call of Duty is among the world’s most profitable game series, with millions of fans playing its latest iteration every year. For Sony, Microsoft’s control of the franchise would make business harder even if the game remains on PlayStation. This is “big news and potentially very negative for Sony,” said Asymmetric Advisors strategist Amir Anvarzadeh. Many PlayStation owners use their consoles solely to play Call of Duty games, purchasing the game at full cost, while Microsoft will likely make the game free on its Xbox Game Pass service, he said in a separate note to investors. Sony also faces a £5 billion suit from UK consumers who argue the royalty fees the Tokyo-based company charges third-party developers inflate game prices. Such fees account for half of the company’s game software sales, Anvarzadeh said.']\n",

      "['A Chinese startup has beaten Elon Musk’s SpaceX in the race to launch a methane-fueled rocket, boosting the nation’s goal of eventually challenging the US as the dominant power in space.  LandSpace Technology Corp. successfully launched the ZQ-2 rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwest province of Gansu on Wednesday, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The successful launch comes after the first attempt failed in December because of an abnormality in a supplementary second-stage engine. After reviews and analysis of the issue, improvement measures were implemented that proved effective in ground tests, the company said in March. The rocket arrived at the launch center in May after traveling nine days from LandSpace’s manufacturing base in Jiaxing. The launch entered its final-stage preparation on July 6, according to the company.   SpaceX and others have been developing rockets that can use methane-based fuel, thanks to its potential to be cleaner and safer than solid propellants, liquid hydrogen and other fuels currently used. The successful launch by LandSpace provides the Beijing-based company with bragging rights and boosts President Xi Jinping’s strategy to have China challenge the US in the race to dominate space. It’s “a major milestone,” said Maxime Puteaux, who researches the space industry as a principal advisor with Paris-based Euroconsult. A startup’s success launching an innovative rocket “proves you can do complex hardware development outside of the Chinese aerospace conglomerates.” Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported better-than-expected sales on a boom in artificial intelligence applications demanding more of the industry-leading firm’s chipmaking capacity. Second-quarter revenue totaled NT$480.8 billion ($15.3 billion) according to Bloomberg’s calculations. That marked a 10% decline on the prior year, though the drop was not as bad as feared, beating an average analyst estimate of NT$476.2 billion. Sales in June came in at NT$156.4 billion. TSMC is the primary contract manufacturer of Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerator chips, widely seen as the best hardware for training large data models such as the one underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Taiwanese firm’s shares were unchanged on Monday before it reported the monthly sales figure. Goldman Sachs analysts earlier raised their target price for the company to NT$700. The stock has risen more than 25% since the beginning of the year, despite the company’s caution that revenue for 2023 might fall low- to mid-single digits in US dollar terms. “We view TSMC as the key AI enabler among our Taiwan semi coverage thanks to its leadership stance in leading edge nodes and advanced packaging technology,” Goldman Sachs analysts Bruce Lu and Evelyn Yu said ahead of the results. The company has 37 buy recommendations, one hold and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Smartphone demand headwinds are proving more formidable than anticipated, detracting from robust AI chip orders. Although TSMC’s reported sales beat consensus, after adjusting for currency tailwinds, results lie at the mid-point of the guidance range. In my view, this underscores the significance of the soft smartphone sector on its overall performance. Moving forward, market conditions warrant closer scrutiny, particularly any indicators of smartphone demand recovery, to gauge their potential impact on 2H earnings trajectory. — Charles Shum, BI analyst']\n",

Stanford Law Professor Doug Melamed, however, said he believes it’s unlikely the appeals court would rule before the deal’s deadline on July 18. “It’s extremely unlikely that the FTC could persuade the Court of Appeals to enjoin the merger before July 18,” said Melamed, a former Justice Department antitrust official.

      "['The pioneer behind Japan’s hoverbikes thought merging with a special purpose acquisition vehicle would be a hassle-free way to go public, raise some cash and grow. Instead, it’s become a case study on how SPAC deals can undermine the future of innovative startups. Aerwins Technology Inc. listed on the Nasdaq in February in one of the most disastrous SPAC mergers of all time. Within a month, its shares plunged almost 90% as spooked investors ran for exits. Founder Shuhei Komatsu resigned, as did all three outside directors on the board, including representatives of the special purpose acquisition company that brought it public. Now a former banker is taking over as chief executive and trying to pull the company out of its tailspin. Aerwins, owned by Tokyo-based A.L.I. Technologies Inc., said in a securities filing that it’s at risk as a going concern, accounting-speak for a company that is less than a year from running out of cash.  “I really hate SPACs,” said Taiji Ito, who was appointed as the new CEO in March. “It was a complete, utter failure.” In Aerwins’ case, as with many SPACs that listed businesses before they were ready, reality clashed with expectations. The startup agreed to merge with Pono Capital Corp. in SeptemberBloomberg Terminal in a deal that was supposed to value the company at about $750 million. That assumed Pono’s investors kept all their money in the combined entity, which would have meant a cash infusion of more than $110 million. Instead, 99% of Pono’s investors chose to redeem their shares, swapping stock for the cash raised at the IPO price, plus any additional incentives and interest earned. The result for Aerwins was that the market debut stripped it of cash instead of replenishing coffers. What was left of the Pono money – about $1.6 million – was used to cover listing costs. Aerwins’ market valuation is $25 million. Even in a terrible year for SPACs, Aerwins’ saga stands out. The 99% redemption rate puts it among the 20 worst SPAC deals by share count since the industry’s pandemic boom, data analyzed by Bloomberg show. Over the past year, completed US SPAC mergers have seen an average of a little less than 90% of shares swapped for cash, according to SPAC Research data analyzed by Bloomberg.  Aerwins develops hoverbikes designed to fly just a few meters above the ground, buoyed by strong air currents that bounce off the earth’s surface. Such vehicles are not typically subject to air travel regulations, though they still need to meet local traffic rules. The bike’s price tag is a lofty $500,000, but Ito says that will go down over time as it manufactures at greater scale. The CEO says that Aerwins is close to inking a deal to sell more than 20 hoverbikes to a state-run company in the United Arab Emirates. The deal, if finalized, would mean $11 million in sales, bolstering chances of a revival. To win the UAE deal, Aerwins must showcase two hoverbikes at the Dubai Airshow in November, an event expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors. In the coming months, it needs to make key modifications to boost the bike’s ability to fly in high-temperatures and windy areas. “It’s one of the hottest places in the world,” Ito said. “If we clear this, I think our product can be usable anywhere.” Tried riding a hoverbike today😎 First female non-employee to be on it😂, they tell me #xturismo #Aerwins pic.twitter.com/GSSFzbkJcz— Min-Jeong Lee (@leeminjeong83) June 5, 2023\\n   He doesn’t have much time. Aerwins had an $8 million operating loss in the year that ended in March and said in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing that there is “substantial doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.” That makes it one of 142 ex-SPACs likely to need more financing in the next year just to keep operating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ito, who has spoken to more than 50 investors since the deal closed, needs to address worries over the viability of the hoverbike as a commercial product and Aerwin’s lack of cash. Ito said he plans to cut costs in half by outsourcing assembly of the hoverbikes while tightening control over the number of parts the startup buys from suppliers. The company also plans to raise about $10 million to $30 million through measures including convertible bonds. Still, winning back market confidence after a nosedive won’t be easy. “It’s tough to get investor interest in a micro-cap stock with a market cap below $30 million that has a going-concern warning and appears to have no access to capital,” said Julian Klymochko, chief executive officer of Accelerate Financial Technologies Inc. “They did not get off on the right foot.”']\n",

      "['One of Blue Origin LLC’s next-generation rocket engines caught fire during testing late last month, an issue that could delay its delivery to a key customer. The incident involved a BE-4 engine and occurred at Blue Origin’s West Texas facility. The Jeff Bezos-backed company didn’t explain what exactly happened, but said there were no injuries and it was narrowing down the cause.  The customer set to receive the engine is a primary launch provider for the US Department of Defense called United Launch Alliance. Its chief executive officer, Tory Bruno, said in a message the BE-4 unit would probably have to be scrapped after the engine “caught fire and was severely damaged.” Bruno added failures aren’t uncommon in so-called acceptance testing, which Blue Origin must complete to ensure the engine is ready for use. The CEO also suggested on social media the issue could be resolved with a quick fix. However, a severe enough problem could push back delivery timelines. Blue Origin said it still expects to meet its engine-delivery commitments this year. It also said it has identified a “proximate cause” and is working on remedial actions, without providing further details. The BE-4 incident was first reported by CNBC. The news site referred to the mishap as an explosion that occurred 10 seconds into the engine test, citing people familiar with the situation. Blue Origin has been developing the BE-4 for the last decade as a primary engine for the company’s future New Glenn rocket, designed to take satellites — and eventually people — into Earth’s orbit. Blue Origin is also supplying the BE-4 engine to ULA for use in the company’s future Vulcan rocket, which is expected to take its debut flight later this year. ULA planned to use the BE-4 that experienced the testing issue as one of the two main engines on the Vulcan’s second flight. Blue Origin said that “ULA was immediately made aware” of the issue. Last year, Blue Origin delivered the engines for the Vulcan’s upcoming debut flight, far later than expected. Those BE-4s have successfully passed acceptance testing and are qualified to fly the mission, according to ULA. A ULA company spokesperson said last month’s fire doesn’t affect that flight, called Certification-1. The debut Vulcan launch is one of two missions that ULA will perform to certify the vehicle for national security space missions.  Certification-1 will carry two satellites for an Amazon.com Inc. initiative to boost broadband access, called Project Kuiper. It will also carry a lunar lander developed by Astrobotic Technology Inc. and a memorial payload for a company called Celestis Inc.']\n",

      "[\"Silicon Valley venture capitalists are racing to get into  artificial intelligence companies — including investors who once bet big on crypto. In the most recent quarter, VCs spent less on crypto and digital asset companies than at any point since 2020, according to data from the research firm PitchBook. At the same time, the total global value of investments in AI for the April-June period was higher than crypto even at its peak. The numbers reflect the recent tendency of many tech investors — even those who once backed crypto — to move away from the scandal-plagued digital asset industry toward the latest advances in AI, said Robert Le, a crypto analyst at PitchBook. New developments in AI have made it highly attractive to investors, at the same time as a barrage of scandals, new regulations and tumbling prices have made crypto toxic.  Joe Zhao, Millennia Capital managing partner, said he’s ready to leave digital assets behind. Zhao and Millennia once backed crypto companies like Blockstream and Lumida; now they’re diving further into artificial intelligence. Millennia has already invested in closely watched startups including Stability AI.  “AI is offering so many more use cases than blockchain,” Zhao said. Some crypto investors have come under fire for kindling an interest in AI. Paradigm, the high-profile crypto VC firm started by Coinbase Global Inc. co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, removed crypto mentions from its website and played up its interest in AI instead, crypto news outlet  the Block reported in May. Huang tweeted this month that the website update had been “a mistake” and directed users to a new version of the company’s homepage that includes moving neon green and black banners emblazoned with the word “CRYPTO.”  Huang said in  a tweet in June that both the crypto and AI sectors “are interesting and will have plenty overlap” and that Paradigm is “excited to continue exploring.”  Meanwhile, Sequoia Capital investor Michelle Fradin, who helped lead the firm’s decision to invest in now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, has recently tweeted more about AI than crypto. She also recently co-authored  a piece for the firm titled, “The New Language Model Stack: How companies are bringing AI applications to life.” Sequoia did not respond to a request for comment.  Some investors believe there are ways to invest in both AI and digital assets. “There is a lot of interest in the intersection of AI and crypto,” Le said. He noted that two startups that straddle these industries — Tools For Humanity, the developer of Worldcoin, and Gensyn — both   raised significant funding rounds during the second quarter. AI and crypto are “natural counterweights for one another,” said  Ali Yahya, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, which backed both Tools for Humanity and Gensyn. “Crypto will will enhance AI by providing some of the decentralization that AI maybe needs,” he said, noting that companies like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. have already amassed significant control over the growing industry. The co-founders of Gensyn, Ben Fielding and Harry Grieve, said that they were more interested in machine learning than crypto prior to founding the startup. And now, despite being mainly backed by crypto venture investors, Gensyn sees itself as more of a technology infrastructure startup. “We don’t think of ourselves as a crypto project so to speak,” Grieve said. Gensyn is building a blockchain protocol that will underpin a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling compute power that can be used for machine learning models. Fielding said the platform could make the compute market more competitive, “since the only suppliers are very, very large organizations who have amassed huge data centers and then rent them out.” Global AI venture funding was roughly flat in the second quarter from the year earlier, though there was a substantial uptick in investments in the US market. By contrast, in the same period, global investment for digital asset startups plunged 76% compared to the same period last year, PitchBook said. Despite the drop, though, crypto deals are still happening. Le noted that crypto markets in Europe, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore are showing more strength than in the US, where regulation has hit the industry hard. He also said he expects to see crypto venture investing continue in the US and abroad, since many crypto funds have mandates that require them to back the space. Andreessen Horowitz, which raised the biggest-ever crypto fund at $4.5 billion, recently   announced that it was opening an office in London because of the UK’s crypto-friendly environment. Yahya said the firm is still committed to investing in crypto startups, including through token rounds. “We don't have any plans of slowing down,” he said.\"]\n",

      "['Microsoft Corp.’s creditors turned slightly more cautious on the software company’s longer-term, high-quality debt after a US judge approved its planned $69 billion deal to buy video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc.  The extra yield investors demand to hold onto Microsoft’s 2.525% senior unsecured bonds maturing in June 2050 over comparable US Treasuries rose by 5 basis points to 70 basis points as of 2 p.m. Tuesday in New York, according to Trace bond data. The risk premium on the tech giant’s 2.921% notes maturing in March 2052 widened 4 basis points to 70 basis points.  “Microsoft’s balance sheet could change dramatically if its US court win against the FTC enables it to ultimately close its $69 billion cash acquisition of Activision,” Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Robert Schiffman and Abigail Marshall wroteBloomberg Terminal Tuesday. Microsoft didn’t respond to a request for comment. The move in long-dated bond spreads indicates wariness among some investors about the company’s plan to merge with Activision, a deal that appears more certain after securing a green light from a US judge and as UK regulators pause their own litigation The company’s bond spreads could widen even further, should Microsoft sell more debt for the sale — which would likely be sold to investors with a concession, said Schiffman. It’s also possible, however, that the software firm uses its $104 billion cash hoard to fund the acquisition and keep its AAA credit rating profile intact, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Microsoft’s shares were little changed in intraday trading as of 2 p.m. in New York, while Activision’s stock was up almost 11% to $91.51, the most since January 2022. ']\n",

      "['Broadcom Inc.’s $61 billion acquisition of cloud-computing company VMware Inc. is poised to be approved by European Union’s merger officials, paving the way for the world’s biggest-ever takeover for a semiconductor maker. The European Commission will give the nod as soon as Wednesday after months of negotiations with the firms, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. During the talks, Broadcom signed up to behavioral remedies including promises to import interoperability standards into its technologies to allow rivals to compete more fairly. Shares of VMware jumped as much as 7.6% to their highest since October 2021 after the Financial Times reported the expected clearance earlier Tuesday. Broadcom declined to comment. The deal had earlier faced heavy scrutiny, with the commission in April highlighting potential reasons to block the deal unless sufficient remedies were forthcoming. It warned the transaction could lead to “higher prices, lower quality and less innovation” for business customers. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority will publish its own provisional findings into Broadcom’s record deal later this month, with a statutory deadline of Sept. 12.  The British regulator — which is finding itself increasingly isolated on tech deal reviews — has taken a tougher stance on future behavioral promises by firms, such as in its probe of Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc. Read More: Microsoft Wins US Court Nod to Buy Activision in FTC Loss  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported better-than-expected sales on a boom in artificial intelligence applications demanding more of the industry-leading firm’s chipmaking capacity. Second-quarter revenue totaled NT$480.8 billion ($15.3 billion) according to Bloomberg’s calculations. That marked a 10% decline on the prior year, though the drop was not as bad as feared, beating an average analyst estimate of NT$476.2 billion. Sales in June came in at NT$156.4 billion. TSMC is the primary contract manufacturer of Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerator chips, widely seen as the best hardware for training large data models such as the one underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Taiwanese firm’s shares were unchanged on Monday before it reported the monthly sales figure. Goldman Sachs analysts earlier raised their target price for the company to NT$700. The stock has risen more than 25% since the beginning of the year, despite the company’s caution that revenue for 2023 might fall low- to mid-single digits in US dollar terms. “We view TSMC as the key AI enabler among our Taiwan semi coverage thanks to its leadership stance in leading edge nodes and advanced packaging technology,” Goldman Sachs analysts Bruce Lu and Evelyn Yu said ahead of the results. The company has 37 buy recommendations, one hold and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Smartphone demand headwinds are proving more formidable than anticipated, detracting from robust AI chip orders. Although TSMC’s reported sales beat consensus, after adjusting for currency tailwinds, results lie at the mid-point of the guidance range. In my view, this underscores the significance of the soft smartphone sector on its overall performance. Moving forward, market conditions warrant closer scrutiny, particularly any indicators of smartphone demand recovery, to gauge their potential impact on 2H earnings trajectory. — Charles Shum, BI analyst']\n",

      "['A Canadian man who mentored drug trafficker Ross William Ulbricht and helped run his Silk Road online marketplace was sentenced Tuesday in New York to 20 years in prison.  Roger Thomas Clark, 61, known online as “Variety Jones,” was arrested in Thailand in 2015, extradited to the US in 2018 and pleaded guilty in 2020 to conspiring to distribute narcotics. Ulbricht, whose alias was “Dread Pirate Roberts,” already is serving a life sentence for creating the sprawling black-market bazaar on the Internet. US District Judge Sidney H. Stein rejected Clark’s plea for no more than the seven-and-a-half years he already spent jailed in Thailand and the US, based on his “material assistance to a major criminal enterprise.” Silk Road was a global hub for hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions using Bitcoin to pay for illegal goods and services, prosecutors said. Clark claimed he was subject to brutal treatment during 31 months in a Thai prison and medical negligence over his five years in US custody. The sentencing was delayed numerous times due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Clark’s limited access to legal materials, and injuries and illnesses he suffered while in jail. Prosecutors argued for 20 years, the maximum available under Clark’s plea deal with the government. Assistant US Attorney Michael Neff argued that Clark had demonstrated “a complete disregard for human life, advocating intimidation and murder to keep Silk Road in operation.” He had the “mentality of a cold-blooded killer,” Neff said. In court papers, the government cited a conversation in which Ulbricht discussed a plan to “track down” a Silk Road employee to make sure he hadn’t gone “off the rails.” Prosecutors claim Clark commented: “Ha, dude, we’re criminal drug dealers — what line shouldn’t we cross?” Clark, dressed in a tan prison outfit, with shackles around his ankles, addressed the judge for 38 minutes before the sentence was announced. Stein had to tell Clark to slow down numerous times to allow the court reporter to keep up. Clark turned to the handful of spectators in the Manhattan court room saying it was “possibly the last time you see me before I get killed.” Clark made detailed claims about corruption among officers in the federal jail in Brooklyn where he is being confined. He also told the judge about being left without medical care for 19 hours in 2021 after falling from the ladder to the bunk in his cell and suffering injuries including a broken pelvis. Clark claimed that, in addition to helping run Silk Road, he had used proceeds from the site to purchase software to help root out criminals who used the dark web to obtain child pornography and for child sex trafficking.  Ulbricht, 39, is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2015 of running Silk Road, where customers used Bitcoin to buy illegal drugs and hacker tools, from 2011 to October 2013. His online alias was taken from a character in the 1987 film “The Princess Bride.” Prosecutors said Clark, who was also known as “VJ,” “Cimon” and “Plural of Mongoose,” advised the younger man on managing Silk Road. “Him coming onto the scene has re-inspired me and given me direction on the SR project,” Ulbricht said of Variety Jones in a 2011 journal entry that was introduced at his trial. “He has helped me see a larger vision. A brand that people can come to trust and rally behind. Silk Road chat, Silk Road exchange, Silk Road credit union, Silk Road market, Silk Road everything!” In addressing the judge, Clark expressed regret for his actions. “I’ve disappointed my family, I’ve lost my god and my freedom,” he said. “There’s really not much more I can screw up, is there?”  The case is US v. Clark, 15-cr-00866, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).']\n",

      "['Now that a US judge has given a green light to the biggest-ever deal in the world of gaming, several governmental hurdles remain. The US Federal Trade Commission, having lost a round in court, could still pursue an administrative antitrust challenge to Microsoft Corp.’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. Microsoft remains mired in a fight with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority as well, but all parties agreed to delay litigation after the US court decision. The companies must make choices about whether to stick with their July 18 deal closure deadline while facing the risk that unresolved regulatory actions may not conclude favorably.  The FTC sued Microsoft last December, alleging that the acquisition would choke off competition in the online gaming market, which mints billions of dollars per year. The agency argued that combining Microsoft, maker of Xbox game consoles, with one of the largest gaming companies — Activision’s titles include the massively popular Call of Duty shooting game — could give it an unfair advantage over rivals. (Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has promised to keep Call of Duty on Sony Corp.’s PlayStation console.)  Having lost in court, the FTC may no longer be the top concern for Microsoft and Activision. That’s because while FTC Chair Lina Khan has emerged as the most aggressive US trustbuster in decades, she’s also shown restraint in the face of defeat: After losing a bid to enjoin an acquisition by Meta Platforms Inc. earlier this year, the FTC abandoned an enforcement action alleging the deal was anticompetitive. If the agency does decide to forge ahead with its challenge to Microsoft-Activision, an administrative trial is set for Aug. 2, with a decision unlikely until later this year.  Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have saidBloomberg Terminal objections to the deal raised by the UK antitrust watchdog are a bigger hurdle for Microsoft than the FTC challenge. The Competition and Markets Authority vetoed the deal in April, arguing it could result in higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation for UK gamers. Microsoft appealed but shortly after the US judge’s ruling, all parties agreed to delay the litigation. Then on July 14, Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft and Activision were considering giving up some control of their cloud-gaming business in the UK as a way to appease the CMA ahead of the July 18 deadline.  Microsoft has strong incentive to close the deal before the deadline to avoid paying a $3 billion breakup fee to Activision. Such steep fees are common in big deals that are likely to face regulatory roadblocks. The companies would have to maintain separate operations in the UK if the deal closes before the CMA appeal is resolved. There’s also a potential downside to closing the deal before it has cleared regulatory scrutiny: Biotech company Illumina Inc. closed its $7.1 billion merger with cancer test provider Grail in 2021 while US and EU investigations were still active. But the EU Competition Commission later threatenedBloomberg Terminal Illumina with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue for acting too hastily and ultimately vetoedBloomberg Terminal the deal. Illumina is appealingBloomberg Terminal in both the EU case and against the FTC.  Microsoft and Activision could extend the closure date to let the CMA appeals process play out in the UK. This isn’t uncommon. VMware Inc. said in May it was agreeing to a three-month extension on the deadline for its takeover by Broadcom Inc. as the $61 billion deal faced scrutiny from both the EU and the UK. Activision Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick said during the US hearing in the FTC case that the company would be forced to abandon the deal if a preliminary injunction were granted, which would let Activision walk away with the breakup fee.']\n",

      "['Microsoft Corp. moved two steps closer to finalizing its $69 billion bid for Activision Blizzard Inc., winning a court fight with US regulators as well as an unprecedented reconsideration from the UK for the largest gaming deal ever. The UK Competition and Markets Authority, which had vetoed the deal in May, said it’s prepared to evaluate proposals from Microsoft and has agreed to a stay in the companies’ appeal before the Competition Appeal Tribunal. “We stand ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns,” a CMA spokesman said, adding that Microsoft and Activision have agreed with the CMA that a stay of litigation in the UK “would be in the public interest” until all parties have submitted their offers. Microsoft and Activision can’t close their deal because of the UK veto, said Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners. “If Microsoft closes the transaction at this moment, it would be a breach of the CMA’s Interim Order, which could leave Microsoft open to a large fine up to 5% of global group revenues of the two parties combined,” said Smith, an ex-CMA legal director.  And while Microsoft and Activision were ebullient about the US decision and UK pause, antitrust experts cautioned that the British regulator’s statement doesn’t mean a settlement is a given. The CMA moved forward alone to win challenges unwinding Meta Platforms Inc.’s acquisition of Giphy and blocked Sabre Corp.’s deal to buy Farelogix Inc., said Bill Kovacic, a former director at the agency. “They are not afraid to do it on their own,” said Kovacic of the CMA, who also served as the US FTC chair during the George W. Bush administration. Activision shares rose 11% to $91.57 at 2:09 pm in New York. The gap between the stock priceBloomberg Terminal and Microsoft’s takeover offer of $95 has narrowed to $3.43, compared with $12.30 as of Monday close. Microsoft was little changed. Read more: The Hurdles That Remain for Microsoft-Activision Deal: QuickTake The CMA announcement came after Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco ruled that the US Federal Trade Commission hadn’t shown Microsoft’s merger with Activision would harm competition for gaming. The decision means 38 jurisdictions have given their blessing to the deal, which has a July 18 deadline for closing. Microsoft has said it struck the deal to acquire Activision in order to add mobile games — an area where it has virtually no presence. Activision owns King, the maker of Candy Crush. The combination will vault Microsoft to the No. 3 slot among global video-game companies behind China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., the publisher of League of Legends, and game console rival Sony Corp., Microsoft had said. “We’re grateful to the court in San Francisco for this quick and thorough decision,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said. “Our focus now turns back to the UK. While we ultimately disagree with the CMA’s concerns, we are considering how the transaction might be modified\\u202fin order to address those concerns in a way that is acceptable to the CMA.” In an email to staff, Activision Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick said the company was “optimistic that today’s ruling signals a path to full regulatory approval elsewhere around the globe.” The FTC said it was “disappointed in this outcome” and would be “announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers,” in the coming days. The antitrust agency could opt to appeal Corley’s ruling or move forward with an in-house proceeding over the deal after it is consummated. The judge’s order allows the FTC to appeal by July 14. In her decision, Corley denied the FTC’s preliminary injunction, which sought to block the deal on the grounds it would harm gamers.  “The FTC has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation, or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets,” she said. At a June hearing, the FTC argued Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision would harm competition since the combined company would have an incentive to withhold key titles, like top-selling shooter game Call of Duty, from rival consoles and subscription services.  The lawsuit was part of an effort by FTC Chair Lina Khan to more aggressively police mergers, particularly those by the biggest tech platforms. Since President Joe Biden appointed her to helm the agency in June 2021, the FTC has killed mergers between Lockheed Martin Corp. and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. as well as Nvidia Corp.’s bid to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s Arm. Microsoft’s paltry mobile gaming presence will see a boost after the tech giant rolls in Activision Blizzard’s Candy Crush and Call of Duty Mobile. Mobile gaming is the fastest-growing segment of the gaming industry and is valued at $92 billion — half of the global gaming market, according to analytics firm NewZoo. However, critics have concerns that Microsoft will use its new leverage to disadvantage competitors like Sony by decreasing access to its blockbuster titles or publishing more games exclusively to Xbox and PC. Corley found evidence presented at the five-day hearing showed the deal would lead to more consumer access to Activision offerings. “Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox,” Corley said. “It made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Switch. And it entered several agreements to for the first time bring Activision’s content to several cloud gaming services.”']\n",

      "['Two UK teenagers were accused of being key members of the notorious hacking group Lapsus$, with prosecutors alleging that the pair were involved in attacks on companies including Nvidia Corp., Rockstar Games Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc. Arion Kurtaj, 18, and a 17-year-old male, who can’t be named for legal reasons, were hit with joint charges including serious computer misuse, blackmail and fraud against BT Group Plc, and Nvidia.  Kurtaj is also separately accused of hacks into Uber, Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto, and fintech firm Revolut Ltd.  The pair are facing a criminal trial in London with prosecutors telling a jury that Kurtaj hacked into Revolut, Uber and Rockstar Games systems in September last year while he was already on bail for the other charges. The lawyers said Kurtaj — together with other unknown members of Lapsus$ — was responsible for stealing commercially sensitive code and video of the latest installment of the Grand Theft Auto series. It’s alleged he posed as a contractor at the firm and was responsible for leaking the hack on forums and soliciting a ransom payment.  Kurtaj was found unfit to stand trial due to medical reasons. That means a jury will only decide whether he is liable for the alleged crimes, rather than guilty of them. He will also avoid jail should he be found liable. The trial is set to last 8 weeks. A lawyer for Kurtaj didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment. Kurtaj’s name can only be reported after reporting restrictions on naming him were lifted Tuesday. The 17-year-old pleaded guilty to two charges relating to the BT hacks but not guilty to the others.  Prosecutors also claim the two teens together hacked into Nvidia in February 2022 by seizing control of two contractors’ accounts. The pair allegedly gained access to sensitive company data including some of the software building blocks of the company’s products.  The hackers stole as much as one terrabyte of data from Nvidia and publicly released some, prosecutors said. They then demanded a ransom payment, threatening to release the rest online if Nvidia didn’t comply, they added. Meanwhile, both teens allegedly hacked into the servers of BT’s EE network between July and November 2021 and threatened to release source code unless a ransom was paid. They also embarked on SIM swap frauds that drained multiple customers cryptocurrency and bank accounts, according to prosecutors. The pair were not just playing “juvenile pranks online” but were using a “very modern criminal method attempting to make money” from the firms, the lawyers told the jury. “Having hacked those companies, the group then attempted to blackmail them and threatened to publish confidential material online unless their demands were met,” said Kevin Barry, the prosecution’s lawyer. “They also used some of the material which they requested during the hacks for fraudulent purposes.” Prosecutors said police and investigators managed to link the hacks to the teenagers through IP addresses linked to various email addresses, mobile devices, and Telegram messaging platform accounts. The teens also regularly boasted online about the hacks. Kurtaj is “highly competent and a genius” but “he’s a teenage lad and he can’t resist bragging,” Barry said.  ']\n",

      "['Salesforce Inc. is raising prices for the first time in seven years after introducing artificial intelligence features. Base prices will go up about 9% across major software product lines in August, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Shares were up about 3.9% in New York following the announcement. Since its last price hike, “the company has delivered 22 new releases and thousands of new features — including recent generative AI innovations,” Salesforce said. Many tech companies are trying to figure out how to profit from new generative AI features, which can be costly to offer due to the large computing resources required. In addition to the list price increases, Salesforce will charge extra fees for new generative features — last month it unveiled an AI “starter pack” that will cost $360,000 per year for 50 users. Software has been getting more expensive this year across many providers, according to an April report from procurement startup Vendr Inc. Average contract value among Vendr’s customers was up 35% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, signaling broad price increases, the company said. The price increase indicates Salesforce may be having difficultly signing new customers, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana. Investors have been concerned about slowing sales growth at the software giant. Higher costs should “provide some cushion” to the company’s full-year revenue estimates, wrote Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne.']\n",

      "['Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup positioning itself as the builder of a safer kind of chatbot, has released a new version of its AI bot, named Claude. Anthropic said that Claude 2 is available to anyone in the US or UK online at claude.ai, and businesses can access it via an application programming interface. The new release on Tuesday comes several months after Anthropic began offering an earlier version of Claude to businesses that wanted to add it to their products. Previously, the bot was tested by a handful of companies including Quora Inc., which built it into an app called Poe that lets users ask questions. Like its predecessor, Claude 2 is built atop a large language model and can be used for written tasks like summarizing, searching, answering questions and coding. Both models can currently take in large chunks of text — a user can ask it to summarize a book, for instance — though Claude 2 can generate longer responses than its predecessor. Responses can reach up to about 3,000 words, according to data provided by the company. Claude 2 will also offer more accurate responses on some topics, such as coding and grade-school-level math, the company said. Anthropic’s goal has been for Claude to be less susceptible than other chatbots to manipulation. The company aims to control the generation of harmful or offensive results in response to prompts — issues that have dogged rival chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The startup said that its tests indicated Claude 2 was better than the existing model at generating what Anthropic calls “harmless responses” to “harmful prompts.” Anthropic president and co-founder Daniela Amodei said that the newer model is meant to “feel, sort of subjectively, a little bit better” than the older version. She added: “And we also know that it’s still not perfect. It still has limitations.” Anthropic, based in San Francisco, was founded in 2021 by a handful of former OpenAI staffers, including Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei. The startup and its leadership have urged caution about the rush to develop and release AI systems, and their potential to transform industries.  In May, the company said it raised $450 million in funding, bringing the company’s total raised thus far to more than $1 billion. Anthropic said it plans to make Claude available to people in more countries in the months ahead.']\n",

      "['Deutsche Bank AG, Commerzbank AG and ING Groep NV are among dozens of companies worldwide whose client data were compromised when a criminal hacking group exploited a security flaw in a file transfer tool. The attackers obtained access to data of thousands clients whose requests to change accounts had been transferred to an external data provider, which the banks in emails to Bloomberg identified as Majorel. The data seen by hackers included clients’ names and their account numbers, ING said in its statement. The software flaw has since been patched, the banks said.  “In the context of a security vulnerability in the MOVEit software that has affected many companies around the world, Majorel Germany was the target of a hacker attack,” a spokesperson for the company said. “The attack took place before the software’s vulnerability became public and only affected a single system running MOVEit software in Germany.” For a QuickTake on the MOVEit attack, click here. The MOVEit attack, which came to light more than a month ago and was allegedly carried out by a criminal hacking group known as Clop, has resulted in the theft of data from dozens of organizations and government agencies in the US and Europe. Notable victims include oil giant Shell PLC and British Airways, along with banks, manufacturing firms, and universities. The breach happens as banks are under pressure to strengthen their IT defenses amid a rising concern that cyber threats are getting more sophisticated and more frequent. The European Central Bank will hold its first cyber stress test of Europe’s banks early next year to map resilience in the industry.  Read More: ECB Cyber Stress Test Won’t Deliver Direct Capital Hit to Banks Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported better-than-expected sales on a boom in artificial intelligence applications demanding more of the industry-leading firm’s chipmaking capacity. Second-quarter revenue totaled NT$480.8 billion ($15.3 billion) according to Bloomberg’s calculations. That marked a 10% decline on the prior year, though the drop was not as bad as feared, beating an average analyst estimate of NT$476.2 billion. Sales in June came in at NT$156.4 billion. TSMC is the primary contract manufacturer of Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerator chips, widely seen as the best hardware for training large data models such as the one underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Taiwanese firm’s shares were unchanged on Monday before it reported the monthly sales figure. Goldman Sachs analysts earlier raised their target price for the company to NT$700. The stock has risen more than 25% since the beginning of the year, despite the company’s caution that revenue for 2023 might fall low- to mid-single digits in US dollar terms. “We view TSMC as the key AI enabler among our Taiwan semi coverage thanks to its leadership stance in leading edge nodes and advanced packaging technology,” Goldman Sachs analysts Bruce Lu and Evelyn Yu said ahead of the results. The company has 37 buy recommendations, one hold and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Smartphone demand headwinds are proving more formidable than anticipated, detracting from robust AI chip orders. Although TSMC’s reported sales beat consensus, after adjusting for currency tailwinds, results lie at the mid-point of the guidance range. In my view, this underscores the significance of the soft smartphone sector on its overall performance. Moving forward, market conditions warrant closer scrutiny, particularly any indicators of smartphone demand recovery, to gauge their potential impact on 2H earnings trajectory. — Charles Shum, BI analyst']\n",

      "[' Like other Taylor Swift fans, I’ve become intimately familiar with virtual queues. But first…  Three things you need to know today:    • Threads hit 100 million users just days after launch• EU sealed a new transatlantic data-transfer pact with the US• A cyberattack forced Ukraine to postpone its June inflation release After three years of the pandemic and a drip, drip of bad news, I suspect many of us are willing to go the extra mile to see our favorite musicians in person. Taylor Swift’s Eras tour is testament to that: She’s expected to make music history (again) by shattering the $1 billion threshold for ticket sales and delivering the highest-grossing tour ever. The bad news? Those seeking the coveted tickets are captives of one of the internet’s most unpleasant rituals. The online ticketing process is an international mess. If you thought the competition for tickets was fierce in the US, try to see a show in Asia. The continent has hundreds of millions of Swift fans and only a handful of stops on the Eras tour. Hong Kong, despite its claims in years past to being “Asia’s world city,” wasn’t among them. That means everyone needs to compete for the shows in Tokyo next February or in Singapore next March or venture farther afield to Australia, France or the UK to get their Swift fix. Few artists have the same gravitational pull. A single Instagram post from Swift reportedly caused US voter registration to spike. Her fans overwhelmed Ticketmaster’s systems in an incident last year that helped push its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment Inc., to face the music in front of the US Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel. Just like in the US, most fans in Singapore had to turn to Ticketmaster as the only viable online platform. The other options were to sign up for United Overseas Bank Ltd.’s credit or debit cards to get an exclusive ticket pre-sale or wait for hours at branches of Singapore Post, according to local media. But that still left thousands disappointed, including a friend and fellow Swift fan in Beijing, who gave up after sitting in a queue behind tens of thousands of others. I had to join a lottery for one of Swift’s four shows in Tokyo, which could only be done on a platform run by the convenience store operator Lawson Inc. Winners will need to secure the tickets on a smartphone app from Avex Entertainment Inc. With few alternative platforms, fans from this part of the world are well-acquainted with scalpers. The resale business is especially strong in China. Earlier this year, tickets to a Beijing show to see the Taiwanese band Mayday sold out online in five seconds, according to Chinese state media outlets. If all other plans fail, a friend in the UK offered to join the lottery there on my behalf. Look what you made me do, Ticketmaster.

      "['Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Day sale can be a frustrating experience because the best deals are often gone in seconds. So this year, the company is dangling an “invite-only” promotion designed to give customers a better shot at snagging the bargains they want. Shoppers request an invite for discounted items they see on the site — 32% off an Acer Swift X laptop, for example, — and get an email if the deal is still available. A unique link lets them buy the product during the sale, which kicked off Tuesday at 3 a.m. New York time and runs through Wednesday.  The new promotion adds a kind of lottery effect to some Prime Day bargains and saves Amazon shoppers the hassle of constantly monitoring the site and refreshing their browsers, said Kristin McGrath, editor of RetailMeNot, which monitors online deals. “This way you either get the deal or you don’t and you don’t waste two days searching for it,” she said.  In a statement, company spokesperson Maria Boschetti said: “Amazon continues to invest in Prime by expanding existing benefits and adding new benefits to add even more value.” Despite a stubbornly high inflation rate and nagging worries about the US economy, legions of consumers are expected to show up for Amazon’s marquee summer sale. Worldwide, shoppers will spend an estimated $12.9 billion during the event, up about 11% from last year, according to Insider Intelligence.  The two-day event is off to a strong start, according to Numerator, which monitors Prime Day sales from a pool of 1,500 unique shoppers. The average order size as of noon New York time was $59, up 15.3% from the same period during last year’s sale. Apple watches and Amazon brand toilet paper were among the top-selling products, indicating people are looking for deals on electronics and household items. Amazon launched Prime Day in 2015 to attract new subscribers who pay $139 a year for shipping discounts, video streaming and other perks. The event helps Amazon lock in shoppers before the holidays and deepen its relationship with existing customers by offering them exclusive deals on Amazon gadgets and other products. About 167 million Amazon shoppers in the US had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Shoppers increasingly see the sale as a valuable aspect of a Prime subscription, according to Prosper Insights and Analytics, which conducts monthly consumer surveys. Some 42% of shoppers said Prime Day deals were one of the reasons they subscribed to Amazon, according to a survey in May, up from 26% four years ago.  Amazon is doing its best to sustain interest by touting “millions of deals,” including as much as 75% off some of its own own signature products, such as Alexa-powered Echo Show smart speakers and Amazon Fire televisions. It also promoted the event through TikTok influencers, hoping to draw younger shoppers from the popular social-media platform. In one promotion, influencer Alix Earle tallied up all the things she planned to purchase during the sale. Such promotions helped boost Prime Day mentions on TikTok 91% from a year ago, according to ComScore Inc. In recent years, Amazon rivals such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have drafted off Prime Day, offering their own discounts and boosting online shopping. US e-commerce sales overall are expected to hit $13.1 billion during the sale, up 9.5% from last year, according to Adobe Inc. Third-party sellers are keen to unload a glut of electronics and apparel during the sale, said Yoni Mazor, founder of GETIDA, a company that helps merchants sell products on Amazon. Many of them bought extra inventory during the pandemic and are still working their way through it, he said. “They need a good outlet to get rid of that stock, and Amazon does a good job of drumming up demand during the summer, which is usually pretty dry for sales,” he said. Prime Day will also fuel Amazon’s advertising business, said Alasdair McLean-Foreman, founder and chief executive officer of Teikametrics, a Boston-based software firm that manages almost $1 billion in annual advertising spending on Amazon, Walmart and other platforms. Amazon is giving advertisers greater visibility into how their campaigns are working in real time, which helps them target their spending more effectively and makes Amazon a good choice for brands otherwise pulling back on their ad spending. “Brands are putting their money where they feel the most confident, and Amazon has so much information about ad performance,” he said. “Prime Day is going to be successful even though there’s this advertising recession.”']\n",

      "['Amazon.com Inc. is fighting the European Union’s decision to include it on a list of Big Tech firms facing extra scrutiny under the bloc’s tough new content-moderation rules. The online retail giant filed a challenge at the Luxembourg-based EU General Court in a bid to topple the European Commission’s decision to label it as a “very large online platform” under the Digital Services Act alongside rival marketplaces such as Google Shopping and Alibaba. “We agree with the EC’s objective and are committed to protecting customers from illegal products and content, but Amazon doesn’t fit this description” and “therefore should not be designated as such,” the company said in an emailed statement. The company’s plea argues that the designation is “based on a discriminatory criterion and disproportionately violates the principle of equal treatment.” Read More: Zalando Takes the EU to Court Over Its New Digital Rules The EU passed the landmark act last year, spurred by what it saw as a failure by powerful firms to combat illegal material on their platforms. The rules require online marketplaces like Amazon to trace the sellers on their platform, add methods for customers to flag illegal content and randomly test for illegal products.  Companies with more than 45 million monthly active users are deemed to be a “very large online platform” and must adhere to stricter criteria set out by the EU’s executive arm, including submitting risk assessments. The 17 companies designated as VLOPs, as well as the two designated “very large online search engines,” must comply with the rules by Aug. 25 or face steep penalties up to 6% of annual revenue. The commission said it would defend its position in court and added that Amazon still must comply with the rules by end of August, regardless of the appeal. “The scope of the DSA is very clear and is defined to cover all platforms that expose their users to content, including the sale of products or services, which can be illegal,” the commission said in an emailed statement. “For marketplaces as for social networks, very wide user reach increases the risks and the platforms’ responsibilities to address them.” Amazon argues that it shouldn’t be considered a VLOP because the majority of its revenue comes from retail, rather than advertising. The company also argues that it is not the dominant retailer in any of the EU countries where it operates, and yet those other companies — national marketplaces like Poland’s Allegro or the Dutch Bol.com — haven’t been earmarked.  “If the VLOP designation were to be applied to Amazon and not to other large retailers across the EU, Amazon would be unfairly singled out and forced to meet onerous administrative obligations that don’t benefit EU consumers,” the Seattle-based company added in its statement.  Zalando SE, a German online fashion firm also targeted by the law, has already filed a suit, claiming the commission misinterpreted its user numbers and that the company also generates most of its revenue from retail rather than ads.

      "['Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Pte warned of an uncertain road ahead as it chalked up its worst showing in seven years. The firm with S$382 billion ($284 billion) in assets posted a total shareholder return of -5.07% for the year ended March 31, the poorest annual performance since 2016. It also suffered a rare net loss.  Its net portfolio value fell from the S$403 billion it held a year earlier. The company said the performance declines were led by a slump in equity valuations, especially in the technology, life sciences and payments sectors, while the S$7 billion loss was driven by unrealized losses from mark-to-market accounting.  Investors worldwide are facing a tough time as geopolitical tensions mount, China’s economy slows and central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation. Temasek’s Chief Executive Officer Dilhan Pillay also highlighted risks ranging from economic decoupling to protectionism and costs tied to energy security and transition.  “There are significant key challenges in the future,” Pillay said in a statement on the annual review — his second since taking charge in October 2021. “The investment climate has become much more complex than what we have encountered since the global financial crisis.” The firm will invest at a moderated pace this financial year but is ready to step up its investments in a market correction, said Chief Investment Officer Rohit Sipahimalani, who flagged the risk of recessions in key developed markets.  “We do believe that to get inflation under control, we probably will need to see a recession, although the timing for that is uncertain,” Sipahimalani said at a news briefing.  Temasek’s woes come as the Singapore government grapples with a budget deficitBloomberg Terminal and rising costs of services. Investment returns from Temasek, GIC Pte and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are among the biggest contributors to the national budget. Part of the slump in performance relates to fiscal-year timing — much of the drop in public equity valuations that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine took place after March 2022. The S&P 500 fell more than 9% during the period. The mark-to-market losses stemmed from an accounting policy that was introduced in the year ended March 2019, said Chief Financial Officer Png Chin Yee, describing them as “paper losses.” The firm faced setbacks from the collapse of companies it invested in. Temasek was forced to write off its $275 million investment in FTX after the crypto exchange’s collapse amid allegations of fraud.  “FTX was an aberration,” Pillay said, acknowledging the reputational damage was significant. Another high-profile investee, Singapore-based startup Zilingo Pte, also suffered a dramatic fall from grace despite boasting several high-profile investors on its board including a representative from Temasek. Investments in Singapore remained the largest contributor to Temasek’s portfolio for the second year in a row and now stand at 28%, up from the 27% recorded last year. While the firm has remained bullish on China for several years, holdings in the country remained unchanged at 22% of its portfolio. The firm’s pace of deals decelerated greatly to S$31 billion, compared with the S$61 billion made in the prior year. That comes after Sipahimalani said last year he’d be slowing the speed of deal-making, warning that valuations still hadn’t fallen far enough to reflect the downside he expected to take place. Temasek has continued to back Chinese companies. It added to holdings in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s US shares during the March quarter, according to 13F filingsBloomberg Terminal, and it also bought shares in rival e-commerce provider JD.com Inc. Both have fallen in value since then. China’s benchmark CSI 300 is little changed this year — putting it among the worst-performing indices in the Asia-Pacific region. Foreign funds are cutting exposure and limiting flows to the market as the economy weakens and relations with the US remain fraught. “I think it’s going in one direction only,” Sipahimalani said of the growing tensions between the US and China. “You have to look at companies that are not caught in the cross-hairs of US-China tensions – that’s just sensible investing right now.” Sipahimalani said Temasek is looking for opportunities in the US private markets as “signs of some cracks” appear due to private equity firms needing to sell their stakes in companies to raise liquidity. Temasek is also seeking to invest more in Southeast Asia due to the region’s favorable demographics and digital economy, Pillay said.  There is a greater need for Temasek to engage more deeply with domestic companies in its portfolio, given the increasing uncertainties and complexity abroad, the CEO said.   Temasek remains the dominant investor in local stalwarts from Singapore Airlines Ltd. to Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. and oil-rig giant Seatrium Ltd. ']\n",

The company wants to focus on managing the surging growth in workers from last year and the on-boarding of specialist workers such as engineers, which takes time. The company is not considering a complete hiring freeze. Chip Gear Makers Brace for Prolonged Semiconductor Demand Slump As ASML’s sales are expected to grow more than 25% this year, “our hiring efforts have resulted in sufficient headcount to support this growth scenario,” Mols said. Equipment makers are facing a slowdown in orders from some customers in the chip market, as rising interest rates and surging inflation dents consumer sentiment. ASML warned at the start of the year of “mixed signals” on demand from different end-market segments.  The firm has a backlog of €38.9 billion ($42.9 billion) but its first-quarter bookings dropped 46% to €3.75 billion from a year earlier.  ']\n",

      "['Tata Group, India’s largest conglomerate, is close to an agreement to acquire an Apple Inc. supplier’s factory as soon as August, marking the first time a local company would move into the assembly of iPhones, according to people familiar with the matter. A takeover of the Wistron Corp. factory in southern Karnataka state, potentially valued at more than $600 million, would cap about a year of negotiations, said the people, asking not to be named as the matter is private. The facility employs more than 10,000 workers, who assemble the latest iPhone 14 model. Wistron has committed to ship iPhones worth at least $1.8 billion from the factory in the fiscal year through March 2024 to win state-backed financial incentives, the people said. It also planned to triple the plant’s workforce by next year. Tata is set to honor those commitments as Wistron exits the iPhone business in India. Spokespersons for Tata, Wistron and Apple declined to comment. The addition of an Indian iPhone is likely to add momentum to Apple’s efforts to diversify its product base beyond China and build up technology manufacturing in the South Asian nation. Wistron exported nearly $500 million in iPhones from India in the three months ended June 30, and Apple’s other key Taiwanese suppliers, Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp., have also ramped up locally. India has made progress in domestic manufacturing since Prime Minister Narendra Modi set up government programs with lucrative financial incentives to expand production and employment. Apple has stepped up efforts to diversify away from China in the aftermath of the country’s Covid lockdowns and rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. An Indian company making iPhones could prove a significant boost for the Modi’s efforts to challenge China’s status as the factory of the world. It may help persuade other global electronics brands to consider production in India to reduce their reliance on China. The 155-year-old Tata Group sells everything from salt to tech services. Over the past few years, the group has sought to make inroads into electronics production and e-commerce, both relatively new territories for the Tata family. It already makes iPhone chassis, or the metal backbone of the device, at its factory spread over hundreds of acres of land in Tamil Nadu state. The Tatas also foster chipmaking ambitions, Chairman N Chandrasekaran has previously said.']\n",

      "['Meituan’s 30% slide this year shows that troubles are deepening for the Chinese food-delivery firm as it faces stiff competition trying to keep market share away from rival ByteDance Ltd. The tech-driven company is facing an increasing challenge from ByteDance — owner of TikTok Inc. — which aims to seize a greater share of Meituan’s retail business via Douyin, a short video platform that also has built-in e-commerce features. Bytedance is also moving into Meituan’s key and profitable food-delivery sector. That spells concern for the Chinese tech firm that is currently the fifth-worst performer on the 30-member Hang Seng Tech Index this year. Through Monday’s close in Hong Kong, Meituan’s decline was more than six times that of the tech gauge and it has slumped about three quarters from a record high close set in February 2021. “Meituan guided for much lower margins to fight off Douyin, and until they change that guidance, or their results show much better margins, there is no reason for investors to change their view,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. One battleground between Meituan and Bytedance is over their so-called in-store business, where the companies charge merchants who issue coupons, vouchers, tickets and accommodation reservations on their platforms.  The next few months may be particularly decisive in the battle between the two firms given they are traditional peak season for hotels and travel, said Jialong Shi, an analyst at Nomura International HK Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It will be a very crucial period to watch, because summer is a big time for local services.” It’s been a challenging year for e-commerce companies in China given the highly anticipated revenge-spending trade has fizzled on the back of a stuttering economy. The disappointment has compelled some firms to offer deep price cuts amid tough competition. Meituan has suffered particularly hard as unlike online-gaming firms, its food-delivery business has a slim margin and low entry barrier. To fend off ByteDance, Meituan earlier this year announced plans to hire as many as 10,000 staff. The decision was met with resistance from investors, who were concerned about margins being hurt.  Read more: China Tech Giant Meituan Hires 10,000 to Counter ByteDance Meituan’s revenue jumped a larger-than-expected 27% in the first quarter, due to rising demand for meal deliveries and travel. The company said its in-store business accelerated in the first quarter after adjusting its subsidy strategy. It’s not all looking bad for Meituan. The company may be able to sustain its lead thanks to the improved operating environment for its in-store business after the Covid lockdowns as well as its heavy subsidies, Nomura’s Shi said. The stock has 59 buy ratings, 2 holds and just one sell, and analysts expect 63% upside over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, Still, analysts have many questions that remain unanswered. Meituan seems too committed to its loss-making community group buying platform, where a number of buyers can purchase products together to fetch deeper discounts. There’s also uncertainty over how the firm will embed AI technology into its current operations after buyingBloomberg Terminal artificial-general-intelligence innovator Light Year last month.  While it may take some time for newcomer Douyin to replicate Meituan’s platform, the food delivery business’s growth has slowed “considerably,” said Kai Wang, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Hong Kong, adding that Meituan has been “burning a lot of cash in their new initiatives.”  “Their in-store business margins are going down faster than expected,” said Wang. “Douyin is going to take a long time to kind of replicate Meituan’s platform, but it’s not impossible for them to do it.” Shares of Meta Platforms Inc. have been on a tear in recent months, more than tripling from their November low. However, the stock that suffered the biggest-ever one-day loss of market value has yet to recoup losses incurred since that fateful day. The Facebook and Instagram parent plunged 26% on Feb. 3, 2022, on the back of woeful earnings results, erasing a record $251 billion in market value. The stock, which is still 9.5% below the close before the market tumble, was edging higher on Tuesday. ']\n",

      "['An artificial intelligence researcher who co-authored one of Google’s most influential papers in the field is leaving the company to launch a startup. Llion Jones, who helped write the pioneering AI paper “Attention Is All You Need,” confirmed to Bloomberg that he will depart Google Japan later this month. He said he plans to start a company after taking time off. “It was not an easy decision leaving Google, it’s been a fantastic decade with them but it’s time to try something different,” Jones wrote in a message to Bloomberg. “It also feels like good timing to build something new given the momentum and progress in AI.” A spokesperson for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since its publication in 2017, “Attention Is All You Need” has become a sensation in Silicon Valley. The paper introduced the concept of transformers, systems that help AI models zero in on the most important pieces of information in the data they are analyzing. Transformers are now key building blocks for large language models, the technology that underpins popular AI products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In the intervening years, the paper’s authors have launched notable startups, including Cohere, which offers LLMs to corporate customers, and Character.AI, which lets users create chatbots emulating celebrities and historical figures. With Jones’ departure, all eight authors have now left Google. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported better-than-expected sales on a boom in artificial intelligence applications demanding more of the industry-leading firm’s chipmaking capacity. Second-quarter revenue totaled NT$480.8 billion ($15.3 billion) according to Bloomberg’s calculations. That marked a 10% decline on the prior year, though the drop was not as bad as feared, beating an average analyst estimate of NT$476.2 billion. Sales in June came in at NT$156.4 billion. TSMC is the primary contract manufacturer of Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerator chips, widely seen as the best hardware for training large data models such as the one underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Taiwanese firm’s shares were unchanged on Monday before it reported the monthly sales figure. Goldman Sachs analysts earlier raised their target price for the company to NT$700.

      "['Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai is planning to leave the ride-hailing company, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the most significant executive departure since the company went public in 2019. Chai informed Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi of his intentions to move on, though a decision on timing hasn’t been made, the people said, asking not to be named discussing non-public information.  “Over the past five years, Nelson has been essential to putting Uber on secure financial footing, steering the company from billions of dollars in losses,” to improved earnings, strong free cash flow and heading toward an operating profit, an Uber spokesman said in a statement. “We are not going to comment on any executive’s potential career decisions during a quiet period.” Chai’s pending departure caps a nearly five-year tenure for the financial-industry veteran that has included important milestones. After being tapped in 2018 by Khosrowshahi to guide Uber through its initial public offering and fix its balance sheet, the 58-year-old was tasked with bringing Wall Street discipline to a freewheeling tech company that was blowing through startup capital to fund explosive growth. Uber had been operating without a CFO for more than three years until Chai came on board. Chai oversaw some of Uber’s biggest highs and lows as a public company. San Francisco-based Uber made several multibillion-dollar deals, like the $2.65 billion acquisition of Postmates in 2020 and logistics operator Transplace for $2.25 billion the following year, purchases that helped Uber diversify beyond rides. When the pandemic decimated demand for ride-hailing, Uber’s bookings fell by as much as 80% and the company cut more than 6,000 employees.  The following year, Chai steered Uber to its first-ever quarter of positive adjusted Ebitda. While the metric strips out some expenses, it served as a strong signal to investors that Uber was moving past its growth-at-all-costs phase.  Uber generated adjusted Ebitda of $186 million in 2022. While the company has yet to post an annual profit on a generally accepted accounting principles basis, Chai and Khosrowshahi have signaled that’s the next goal. Ratings firm Moody’s Investors Service lifted the company’s credit grade earlier this year, citing substantial improvements in profitability and cash flow generation that it expects to be sustained. Before Uber, Chai had been a longtime lieutenant of Wall Street veteran John Thain — the former top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chai later went on to take senior roles at the New York Stock Exchange, Merrill Lynch and CIT Group, crossing paths again with Thain. At Merrill Lynch, Chai and Thain helped the bank weather the 2008 financial crisis, selling the firm to Bank of America Corp. in what was seen as a coup to avoid a possible collapse. The pair left soon after the deal, only to be reunited at commercial lender CIT Group. Right before he joined Uber, Chai was CEO of insurance company Warranty Group Inc., which was backed by private equity giant TPG before its sale to Assurant Inc.']\n",

Can’t believe it’s only been 5 days!”  The Threads app, a spinoff from Instagram that uses people’s accounts for that service, got off to a scorching start on Wednesday and racked up 70 million users within two days, going “way beyond our expectations,” Zuckerberg said earlier.

Threads will reach close to 200 million daily active users and generate about $8 billion in annual revenue over next two years, Evercore ISI analysts led by Mark Mahaney estimate.  The text-centric service closely resembles Twitter in look and functionality, earning the displeasure of Twitter owner Elon Musk who has accused it of being a copycat and an “Instagram minus pics.” The two billionaire owners have traded jibes in recent weeks and Threads is now at the center of an intensifying rivalry. The new app’s launch has benefited from Meta’s immense reach — Instagram alone has more than a billion regular users — and changes at Twitter that have alienated large swathes of its most active user base. Threads still lacks a number of basic features, such as a chronological feed composed solely of people you choose to follow, but it provides a very familiar experience and doesn’t yet have any advertising.

Threads will reach close to 200 million daily active users and generate about $8 billion in annual revenue over next two years, Evercore ISI analysts led by Mark Mahaney estimate.  It’s off to a good start: Instagram’s new app, designed as a direct rival to Elon Musk’s Twitter, signed up 100 million users in the days since Meta launched the service last Wednesday. It’s a fraction of the $156 billion average annual revenue analysts expect Meta to generate in fiscal 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, but ahead of the $5.1 billion in sales and revenue Twitter earned in its last full year as a public company. Last year, Meta brought in about $117 billion in revenue and has more than 3 billion active users across its social media apps. Threads’ biggest rival Twitter, which has been beset by controversy since Musk acquired it last year, had 237.8 million users as of July 2022. It will be interesting to see if Threads can maintain a reasonably robust growth rate and keep users engaged without meaningfully cannibalizing engagement on Meta’s other platforms, Facebook and Instagram, Mahaney, who has an outperform rating on the stock, wrote in a research note. His peer from KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Justin Patterson, also sees the app bringing in several billions of dollars in ad revenue for the company but it “will be an immaterial contributor near term as Meta likely focuses on adoption over monetization.” Mark Zuckerberg, who has been very active on his new platform, seems to share that view.  Late last week, he posted on Threads saying “our approach will be the same as all our other products: make the product work well first, then see if we can get it on a clear path to 1 billion people, and only then think about monetization at that point.”  Meta’s stock has more than doubled this year and jumped as much as 2.6% to touch a 17-month high in Monday trading.

Last week, Vedanta said it will acquire the semiconductor and display glass units from a group company. The foray into the electronics manufacturing sector has been stymied mainly due to a delay in state financing for the chip venture. The Indian government had asked the Vedanta-Foxconn chip venture to reapply for incentives as the original plan to make 28 nanometer chips had changed. Foxconn eventually acquired manufacturing-grade technology for producing 40 nanometer chips, Vedanta had said.  Vedanta said later on Monday that it is fully committed to its semiconductor project and has lined up other partners to set up India’s first foundry.  “We have the license for production-grade technology for 40 nm from a prominent integrated device manufacturer,” it said in a statement, without specifying who it had acquired the technology from. “We will shortly acquire a license for production-grade 28 nm as well.” India’s minister of state for technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said in a tweet that Foxconn’s decision has no impact on India’s ambitions.

      "['The European Union approved a new deal governing transatlantic data transfers after it said US President Joe Biden addressed warnings from EU courts that American security agencies could unfairly access citizens’ data. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday said the EU’s executive adopted a so-called adequacy decision, allowing thousands of firms to safely ship data to the US without fear of violating EU privacy law — for the time being. Didier Reynders, the EU’s justice commissioner, told reporters in Brussels he’s “sure” the new pact will also face a challenge at the EU’s top court, like its two predecessors, which were thrown out by judges over fears of weak privacy protections. “Following the agreement in principle I reached with President Biden last year, the US has implemented unprecedented commitments to establish the new framework,” von der Leyen said in a separate statement. “Today we take an important step to provide trust to citizens that their data is safe, to deepen our economic ties between the EU and the US, and at the same time to reaffirm our shared values.” Monday’s step is the latest round in a long—running saga that eventually saw Meta Platforms Inc. and thousands of other companies plunged into a legal vacuum. In 2020, the EU’s top court annulled the so-called Privacy Shield, the previous pact regulating transatlantic data flows. Businesses, large and small, move around vast amounts of information needed for everything from sales and marketing to payroll processing, meaning that legal barriers risked disrupting commerce between the EU and US. Privacy campaigner Max Schrems has been behind the two EU court cases that ended up striking down down the bloc’s previous transatlantic data flow decisions. He’s been getting ready to challenge the latest pact as well. “They say, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,” he told Bloomberg. “It seems the commission is trapped in such a political circle. We have various options for a challenge already in the drawer, even if we are equally as sick and tired of this legal ping-pong.” The latest EU decision follows months of negotiations with the US, which last year yielded an executive order by President Joe Biden and US pledges to ensure that EU citizens’ data is safe once it’s shipped across the Atlantic. On July 3, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the US had now “fulfilled its commitments” toward the EU.  The uncertainty at one point led Meta, Facebook’s parent company, to threaten a total withdrawal from the 27-nation EU.  In May, it was hit by a record €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) EU privacy fine and given a deadline to stop shipping users’ data to the US via a separate tool, over the same fears that EU data wasn’t safe on the US side.']\n",

Recently, more US-published games have featured more non-White characters. Many top gaming companies are also making a concerted effort to diversify their workforces. Recently, Activision Blizzard Inc. announced that under-represented ethnic groups made up 39% of the employees in 2022 — up three percentage points from the year before. The trade group’s annual survey said active players in the US fell slightly last year to 212.6 million. Men ages 18 to 44 were most likely to consider themselves active players. Their play time shrank by 4% in 2022, with a number reducing engagement to one to three hours a week, falling into the casual category, from the four-plus for the busiest gamers.']\n",

      "[' Some drive-thrus have started testing automated ordering. But first...  Three things you need to know today:    • China ended its tech crackdown with fines for Tencent and Ant• Meta’s Threads had 70 million sign-ups• Apple plans a slow rollout of the Vision Pro As I pulled up to the Del Taco drive-thru, a vaguely robotic voice greeted me: “Hi. What can we make fresh for you today?” This fast-food joint in Riverside, California, is one of about 300 restaurants, which also includes some Carl’s Jr. locations, using an automated system to take drivers’ orders. Presto Automation Inc., which makes the drive-thru chatbot, said the system uses artificial intelligence to improve the responses over time. For now, though, the machine is limited to a set of preprogrammed replies. That makes it, in effect, more like interacting with an automated phone system than with ChatGPT. For an added layer of quality control, Del Taco assigns a human worker behind the counter to listen in on all orders and intervene when prompted or when they sense the customer is growing frustrated. In my tests, the system rerouted me to a person four out of five times. (I didn’t end up actually consuming five orders of Del Taco, for the record.) Even in its current form, the automated drive-thru can reduce a restaurant’s labor needs by as much as 40 hours a week, said Presto Chief Executive Officer Krishna K. Gupta. The bot is also designed to be a model employee. It’s coded to politely upsell drinks or other meal add-ons, which helps drive sales. The American fast-food cashier is at risk of going the way of the call center employee. That could have a significant impact on the labor market. Food preparation and serving is the fourth-largest industry in the US, making up about 8% of jobs, according to US labor data. At Del Taco, Presto’s service has reduced the burden on the kitchen team by handling about 70% of orders, said Chad Gretzema, brand president for the restaurant chain. It has offered an upsell option about 80% of the time, he said. The system only works in English, but Presto plans to add Spanish down the line. The executives said the inconsistency I experienced was out of the norm. The machine handed me off when I asked various questions, such those about drink options, more involved substitutions or possible food allergies. To the last question, it would only provide a basic list of ingredients and refused to divulge the contents of Del Taco’s secret sauce. (The internet thinks it’s mostly mayonnaise.) Presto is “focused on just automating orders,” Gupta said. “The reality is that 90-something percent of people coming through the drive-thru are really just coming in, and they are asking for an order.” Of my orders the restaurant took — whether fully automatically or with some help of a human employee — all were accurate, including when I made modifications partway through or changed my mind about what I wanted. It readily complied with my request to remove tomatoes from the taco order and add chicken to my quesadilla even though I asked at the last moment. After placing my orders, I stood at the drive-thru exit to interview customers. The reviews were mixed. Some said they were just as satisfied talking to a bot than they would have been with a person, but others described the experience as less personal. Regardless, the switch could be inevitable, said Gupta: “I really believe that in three years’ time, there’s going to be no humans taking the order.” Silicon Valley is deep in the throes of a chatbot craze, with companies like OpenAI notching valuations in the billions. But none are quite as strange as Character.AI. The AI startup, valued at $1 billion, allows people to create their own custom chatbots, impersonating anyone and anything — living or dead or inanimate. An AI tool has shown promise at helping doctors fight aggressive brain tumors by identifying characteristics that help guide surgery. A sluggish market for IPOs and a steady appetite for growth capital means private credit has an opportunity to play a vital role in bridging that gap for burgeoning tech companies, argues a Blackstone Credit executive. The co-founder of the digital telecom provider Circles is stepping down from the company’s management team, part of an internal staffing overhaul aimed at shedding costs after years of attempts to take on Singapore’s incumbent services.

      "['China is tightening controls on independent content creators in its latest regulatory guidelines for tech companies. Online platforms must take timely action to monitor and suspend user accounts that spread false information or weigh in on hot-button topics in a harmful manner, among other steps required by the Cyberspace Administration of China in a notice published on Monday. The thirteen guidelines, which were dated from last week, did not outline specifics about the type of content that would be considered illegal or harmful, but said that it is the responsibility of platform providers to strengthen their management of these so-called self-media accounts. Among the enumerated requirements are better verification of accounts and labeling of rumors or controversial content, and streamlining the algorithm to promote more content that dispels rumors. The document directs platform operators to strictly verify content creators producing information in realms including finance, education, media and public health. This comes after China released draft guidelines on Friday requiring online service providers to clamp down on cyberbullying content, under threat of fines that can be levied under existing laws for online security and personal data protection. It’s the latest in a string of measures from the CAC to tighten the reins over tech platforms including those from Tencent Holdings Ltd., ByteDance Ltd. and the Twitter-like Weibo. Read more: China Warns its Tech Giants to Rein in Cyberbullying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported better-than-expected sales on a boom in artificial intelligence applications demanding more of the industry-leading firm’s chipmaking capacity. Second-quarter revenue totaled NT$480.8 billion ($15.3 billion) according to Bloomberg’s calculations. That marked a 10% decline on the prior year, though the drop was not as bad as feared, beating an average analyst estimate of NT$476.2 billion. Sales in June came in at NT$156.4 billion. TSMC is the primary contract manufacturer of Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerator chips, widely seen as the best hardware for training large data models such as the one underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Taiwanese firm’s shares were unchanged on Monday before it reported the monthly sales figure. Goldman Sachs analysts earlier raised their target price for the company to NT$700. The stock has risen more than 25% since the beginning of the year, despite the company’s caution that revenue for 2023 might fall low- to mid-single digits in US dollar terms. “We view TSMC as the key AI enabler among our Taiwan semi coverage thanks to its leadership stance in leading edge nodes and advanced packaging technology,” Goldman Sachs analysts Bruce Lu and Evelyn Yu said ahead of the results. The company has 37 buy recommendations, one hold and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Smartphone demand headwinds are proving more formidable than anticipated, detracting from robust AI chip orders. Although TSMC’s reported sales beat consensus, after adjusting for currency tailwinds, results lie at the mid-point of the guidance range.

      "['Amazon.com Inc.’s annual Prime Day shows that e-commerce isn’t the driver it once was for the stock, as investor focus shifts to the company’s faster-growing and profitable cloud-computing unit.   In the past four years, the stock has fallen in the week of the two-day sale in which the retail giant discounts swathes of items. The first four years beginning in 2015 saw Amazon shares average a gain of more than 2% in the week of the event, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The focus on cloud computing has only increased as Amazon Web Services grew into the company’s main source of operating income, amid greater investor scrutiny over who stands to benefit most from the rollout of artificial intelligence applications. “Most people invest in Amazon for both” e-commerce and AWS, Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors, said in an interview. But with “AI being part of the conversation kind of almost every minute of every day, it’s clearly the AWS opportunity and the potential AI implications” that’s proving to be more attractive.  Prime Day, which begins on Tuesday, is likely to generate about $5 billion of incremental revenue this year, according to JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth. While that would be up 13% from last year, the pace of growth has slowed steadily each year since a 30% increase in 2020, Anmuth wrote in a recent research note. Even though Amazon’s retail business accounted for almost two-thirds of sales last year, the faster-growing AWS unit was responsible for all of the company’s $12.2 billion in operating profit. While growth at AWS slowed to a record low in the first quarter, analysts are optimistic that demand for so-called generative AI applications is poised to reinvigorate sales.  Amazon shares have rallied 55% this year, as the company works to slash expenses in part by eliminating at least 27,000 jobs. Despite the advance, it’s still about 30% below its 2021 peak.  In April, Amazon unveiled generative AI technology aimed at cloud customers as well as a marketplace for AI tools from other companies. It’s also investing $100 million to help customers develop and deploy new kinds of AI products as it competes with the cloud computing units of Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.  “Prime Day will be a good branding opportunity to capture not only sales, but new customers into the Amazon web,” said Sylvia Jablonski, co-founder and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. “However, the future for Amazon is very likely in AWS and its participation in the innovation and growth of AI.”  With technology stocks boosted by the investor frenzy over artificial intelligence, about a quarter of Nasdaq 100 companies have set fresh all-time highs this year. Around 90% of firms on the tech-heavy gauge have hit new records since 2021, but that’s not the case for some stars of the dotcom era including Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., which have not yet fully recouped losses from the subsequent crash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The index, which has rallied 37% this year, was little changed on Monday. ']\n",

      "['Among the lawyers, litigants and spectators who packed into a San Francisco courtroom last month for a hearing on the fate of the biggest video gaming deal ever was another breed altogether: the merger arbitrager. Portfolio managers and analysts from a handful of top investment firms, as well as specialized brokers who bet on whether mergers will go through, flew in from New York and Chicago. They were there to watch for signs — a grimace from the judge, a goof by a key witness — that the US Federal Trade Commission would succeed or fail in its bid to temporarily block Microsoft Corp.’s proposed $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc. while the agency pursues an administrative challenge to it. “This trial is a key event in the arbitrage community,” Brian Lombardi, a New York-based broker at FBN Securities, said on the sidelines of the hearing. “Everyone wants to understand the outcome. If the preliminary injunction is granted, the deal is likely dead.” Lombardi was joined in US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley’s 19th-floor courtroom by representatives of firms including Balyasny Asset Management, Citadel Enterprise Americas, Pentwater Capital Management, TIG Advisors and United First Partners. The group, numbering a dozen or so, often grabbed spots in the first three rows of the public seating area. Some paid line sitters $30 to $40 an hour to keep their place. Scores of their counterparts followed the courtroom action on a Zoom audio feed.  Merger-arbitrage investors profit from the deal spread that arises when acquisitions are announced — the difference between the offer price and the stock price, reflecting the prospect of success and the risk of failure. Monitoring legal proceedings that can make or break major tie-ups is a standard part of their job, but has become especially fraught under FTC Chair Lina Khan, the most aggressive trustbuster the US has had in decades.   Read More: Lina Khan Is Upending Wall Street’s Merger-Arbitrage Playbook  The mammoth Microsoft-Activision combination would reshape the lucrative video game industry and, more broadly, test the FTC’s ability to block tech deals in court. How Corley rules, and the language of her ruling, could swing portfolio values by tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars.  And with a July 18 deadline for the deal to close, she is expected to rule soon. Since the transaction was announced in January of last year, the gap between Activision’s price and Microsoft’s $95-a-share takeover bid has fluctuated along with regulatory updates, with the shares sinking almost to $70 in November and then gradually climbing back.  Tech Watch: Activision Traders See More Microsoft-Driven Gains Should the deal close, buying Activision at Friday’s closing price of $82.43 would mean a 16% gain. Many arbitragers could realize even bigger gains with positions they built at lower prices last year. It has been one of the most popular arbitrage positions, attracting experienced players like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Pentwater Capital and Arrowstreet Capital, according to filings data at the end of the first quarter compiled by Bloomberg. The outcome will also help arbitragers assess the regulatory landscape for big tech M&A going forward. The first half of the year has been tough for this corner of the market, which is being upended by Khan’s antitrust scrutiny of blockbuster deals from pharmaceuticals to big tech.  By the end of the hearing, a consensus had emerged among the arbs that the FTC was unlikely to win a pause on the Microsoft deal, just as it lost a challenge to an acquisition by Meta Platforms Inc. earlier in the year. During the two weeks of the proceeding, Activision gained almost $2.50 — from $81.89 on June 20 to $84.30 on June 30 — in a sign of increased market confidence. “The FTC appears to lack a strategy,” Lombardi said. “Acting tougher is one thing, but taking bad cases to court and losing creates unfavorable precedents that put the FTC in a worse position than before she took the helm,” he said of Khan. Read More: Microsoft Judge Grills Regulator on User Harm in Gaming Deal  FTC spokesman Douglas Farrar said the agency “only brings cases when the facts show that a proposed merger would stifle competition or create a monopoly.” When it acts, he said, “we do so firmly grounded in the law and decades of precedent, honoring our clear congressional mandate to prevent unlawful mergers.” In one of the highest-profile deals last year, Twitter Inc. arbitragers endured a months-long roller-coaster ride in the stock as Elon Musk tried to back out of his takeover, ultimately agreeing to honor it just before the case went to trial. But the reward was huge for those who stuck around: Twitter shares fell roughly 40% below the offer at one point, providing huge upside to anyone betting the deal would close. It was for a big payday from the Activision deal that traders showed up at the courthouse on foggy San Francisco mornings, despite having the option to listen to the audio stream. Traders say the advantage of being present is close observation of the judge, including body language that reflects skepticism (or boredom), as well as her exchanges with witnesses or lawyers that can offer clues to the outcome. Read More: Microsoft CEO Says ‘Call of Duty’ to ‘100%’ Stay on PlayStation Some arbitragers said they flew home on weekends to attend their kids’ sports activities, and tried to make it back in time for the next hearing. Sitting in court on hard wooden pews, they eagerly took notes that were then sent out as reports to colleagues and clients. Some who listened on the Zoom said they probably missed out on small yet significant details, like what figures Microsoft’s attorney wrote on a whiteboard in court as she questioned expert witnesses. Nick Pappas, a New York-based analyst for Churchill Capital, who was on the audio feed, recalled hiring a line sitter for seven hours to hold a spot during the federal court hearing over the Justice Department’s challenge to AT&T Inc.’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner in 2018. For various reasons he couldn’t make it to San Francisco for this one, he said.  “Resource prioritization and schedule — what’s better worth your time?” Pappas said. “With Zoom you can do two things at once, staying on top of other breaking news. But investors with big enough positions will find it worth their time. Many arbs have legal backgrounds, so they can potentially benefit more.” Read More: Microsoft Game Deal to Harm PlayStation, Sony Executive Says  US authorities aren’t the only ones who have expressed concern over the Activision deal. UK competition regulators vetoed it. Microsoft is appealing that decision. Even if the FTC loses, the companies may choose to extend their July 18 closing deadline. Otherwise they might risk being forced to unwind the transaction by the UK or by a separate FTC challenge. The arbitragers may have to tune in to more proceedings to handicap how it will all play out. “Part of an arbitrager’s job entails doing deep dives into sometimes arcane issues,” said Roy Behren, co-chief investment officer at Valhalla, New York-based Westchester Capital Management, who has managed merger arbitrage strategies for almost 30 years. He listened to the feed of the Microsoft hearing but also hired a lawyer to attend it in person. “We have to cover a lot of bases,” he said.']\n",

Sherman Lin, chairman and chief executive officer of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, estimates that initial public offering applications will reach 40 this year — the most since 2013 — with firms from the electric vehicle, cloud computing and biotech sectors leading the rise. Requests for new share sales on its innovation board will likely double after only eight companies applied in 2022. Technology “is the driving engine in Taiwan but there are a lot of industries that are below the radar,” Lin said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday. “We hope to attract these hidden champions to our stock market and showcase them to the global market.” Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dominates Taiwan’s equity market with 28% weighting in the benchmark Taiex Index.

The bourse has reformed its industry classification to help widen the diversification of firms on the exchange. It is also working on enhancing its global image and improving information accessibility for traders in an effort to draw more foreign investors.  “There are signs that we can be less pessimistic about the future,” said Lin, adding that the stock market reflects expectations that the economy will “rebound” this year.  Lin is also preparing to visit New York and Boston in September — his first official trip since taking the helm in 2022 — to court foreign investors who account for 40% of Taiwan’s stock market value.

A representative for TikTok said the company does not allow violent threats or incitement to violence, and actively removed posts that violated its rules during the riots. Snap had a dedicated task force reviewing reports from areas affected by the rioting and found that the vast majority of content in question did not promote violence, a spokesperson said.

      "['A bearish research report on Chinese banks by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has drawn fresh criticism from a major lender and one of the nation’s largest macro hedge funds after receiving a backlash from state media. Goldman’s assumptions have “misled some investors and caused them to worry about the asset quality,” China Merchants Bank Co. said in a clarification statement to investors that was seen by Bloomberg News.  Shanghai Banxia Investment Management Center also dismissed the note on Monday, saying the US bank’s prediction that local government debts would sink Chinese banks’ profits and push up their bad loans will likely be proven wrong. At stake was a report published by Goldman analysts including Shuo Yang last Tuesday, which highlighted margin risks and potential credit losses from banks’ exposure to local government debt. Yang, a former official at the China banking regulator, estimated that the “implied loss ratio of credit portfolio in debt investment book” could reach 25% for Merchants Bank, compared with 6% on average for lenders under its coverage. A representative for Goldman declined to comment. Goldman Targeted by China State Media for Bearish Bank View China Tightens Grip on Markets After Selloff in Currency, Stocks Xi Upends the Secretive World of $10,000-an-Hour China Experts Shares of Merchants Bank have lost 12% in Hong Kong since Goldman cut its target price for the second time in three months with a neutral rating. The US bank now has one of the lowest target prices for the Chinese lender, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Merchants Bank argued that Goldman’s report is “illogical” in the way it calculates the potential losses, “lacks basic common sense,” and also overestimates its exposure to the local government financing vehicles.  Pushback against negative financial commentary in China has become more noticeable in recent weeks, with a prominent finance writer and two of his peers getting suspended from a social media platform for spreading “negative and harmful information” about the nation’s faltering stock market. Such moves risk stoking concern among foreign investors about access to independent information on Chinese companies and the economy. Goldman’s report comes at a time when investor concerns are mounting over the health of China’s debt-laden local-government financing vehicles. Worries that banks may incur losses from these debts started spiraling after some state-owned lenders began to offer extra credit support to LGFVs. Merchants Bank said it had about 132.6 billion yuan ($18.3 billion) of loans to LGFVs on its balance sheet at the end of 2022, much lower than Goldman’s estimate of 1 trillion yuan.  Separately, Banxia Investment said some local authorities’ recent moves to replace debts with ultra-low-interest, long-term loans can help them avoid defaults and spare banks from booking a big increase in bad loans, according to an article on its Wechat account.  “In a rates market with adequate administrative management and notable segregation, Chinese regulators have enough incentives, wisdom and methods to keep major banks’ balance sheets undisturbed,” the fund said. This isn’t the first time Wall Street research has proved controversial in China. The last high-profile saga involved an “uninvestable” call on Chinese Internet firms by JPMorgan Chase & Co. last year, which eventually cost the brokerage a senior underwriter role in a stock listing. The incident underscored the tricky path global banks have to navigate as they ramped up their businesses in China, while still giving clients access to candid research on the country’s turbulent markets.']\n",

Its trailer opens with a single line in English: “We are executing a lithography machine trading war against China’s government.” The title can also be read as a pun on My Chinese Heart, as “chip” and “heart” sound the same in Chinese. Its official name in English is The Best Chip. Read: Aggressive US Chip Strategy Forces China Into a Corner ASML has not been able to sell its most potent offering, extreme ultraviolet lithography systems, to China since the Trump administration pressured the Dutch government to deny a license for it. The Netherlands and the US reached an agreement earlier this year to ban ASML from selling some machines in its second-most advanced lineup, affecting its DUV systems. DUV machines are indispensable for the fabrication of a wide range of chips powering products from smartphones to electric vehicles.']\n",

      "['Axiata Group Bhd., Malaysia’s biggest wireless carrier by revenue, plans to sell stakes in some of its businesses and list its technology units to reduce debt taken to fund the acquisition of telecom assets overseas. “We will start with monetization,” Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sood said in an interview at his office in Kuala Lumpur.  Axiata’s balance sheet has been bogged down by debt, which ballooned to 36.7 billion ringgit ($7.9 billion) at the end of March from 25.7 billion ringgit at the end of 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The debt load shot up after its overseas expansion last year, including buying telecom towers in the Philippines and a broadband and cable TV provider in Indonesia. The planned stake sale in its wireless tower unit Edotco Group Bhd. is among options Axiata is weighing to slash debt, Sood said. Edotco was exploring selling new shares to raise as much as $750 million and has shortlisted candidates for the transaction, Bloomberg News reported in March. “We’re are still evaluating the offers and haven’t made a decision,” Sood said, adding the company may explore a listing if it decides against the stake sale. Axiata is revamping PT Link Net in Indonesia into a fixed broadband infrastructure company and positioning PT XL Axiata as a converged mobile, fixed and content service provider, Sood said. There could be a stake sale in Link Net afterwards, he added. Founded in 2008, Axiata has 150 million subscribers for its services across Southeast Asia and Pakistan. The company is exploring a strategic review of its businesses with total assets of about 81.6 billion ringgit, Bloomberg News reported in March. Shares of Axiata have fallen about 18% this year. While some of Axiata’s global peers such as Norway’s Telenor ASA have exited or are conducting strategic business review in high-risk countries such as Myanmar and Pakistan, the Malaysian carrier is staying put, citing long-term growth potential. But these operations must fund themselves and Axiata may sell stakes in these units to strategic investors, Sood said. Axiata has recently expanded into digital financial services and artificial intelligence. Its fintech arm Boost has a valuation of $400 million. Axiata Digital & Analytics., an AI firm backed by SoftBank Corp. and Sumitomo Corp., is worth $500 million, Sood said. ADA has set sights on becoming a unicorn, a term that describes startups worth $1 billion or more, by 2026, Sood said. Axiata plans to bring in new investors in Boost and ADA and list them in two to three years, he added.  Excerpts from the interview: ']\n",

      "['Bitcoin investors are drawing succor from a surge in the smaller token Litecoin over the past year that has outstripped the broader crypto market. That’s because one of the drivers of Litecoin’s near 90% climb over the period was its so-called halving — or halvening — that will curb the supply of the token, a process that also lies ahead for Bitcoin in coming months. “Litecoin often served as a sentiment metric on the Bitcoin halving, being scheduled in advance compared to it,” Matteo Greco, a crypto research analyst at Fineqia, wrote in a note. Litecoin was created in 2011 and aims for faster transactions than Bitcoin. Both blockchains use the “proof-of-work” mechanism, whereby power-hungry computer rigs — known as miners — solve complex puzzles to secure the digital ledgers. A halving cuts in half the amount of tokens miners receive as reward for their work. The quadrennial event, due next month for Litecoin and around April 2024 for Bitcoin, is part of the process of capping the supply of the tokens to 84 million and 21 million, respectively. Litecoin’s performance over the past 12 months beat Bitcoin’s advance of about 39% as well as the 22% increase in a gauge of the largest 100 tokens. But Litecoin has tempered of late, receding a bit from an early July peak. Halving is among a confluence of variables contributing to Bitcoin’s partial rebound this year from a 2022 crypto rout sparked by tightening monetary policy and exacerbated by blowups such as the FTX exchange’s implosion. Other tailwinds for the token include optimism about increasing demand if BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments and others succeed in their efforts to start spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US.  An institutional-only crypto exchange, EDX Markets, also recently went live with backing from billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities as well as Fidelity and Charles Schwab Corp. It offers trading in only four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. While Bitcoin hit records after each of its last three halvings, the current outlook for crypto is clouded by the prospect of more central bank interest-rate hikes to tighten liquidity and curb inflation. Investments like stocks have already begun to falter after a robust first half, with sentiment hit by a jump in government bond yields. Traditional markets “seem to be entering a more risk-off mood – we can’t yet assume that Bitcoin will just shrug that off,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.  “The especially interesting story will be how Bitcoin behaves when the stock market correction eventually arrives in earnest,” she added. Bitcoin and Litecoin remain well below record levels achieved in 2021. Litecoin slipped 2.5% to $93.98 at 11 a.m. in London on Monday, having peaked at $413 during the pandemic-era bull market. Bitcoin traded at roughly $30,000, some $39,000 below its all-time high.']\n",

      "['As Jack Ma’s clash with the Chinese government draws to a close after almost three years, it’s clear how costly the conflict has proven for his companies, Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chinese authorities said on Friday they would wrap up a probe into Ant with the financial technology company paying a fine of almost $1 billion. The investigation began after Ma critiqued Beijing’s regulation of the financial sector in 2020, forcing Ant to pull the plug on what would have been the largest initial public offering in history. The costs go far beyond the latest fine. The crackdown has added to an erosion of confidence in the private sector in China as the country faces growing weakness in everything from consumer spending to the housing market, exports and infrastructure investment. Ant has had to overhaul its business model, pulling back from sensitive sectors and easing up on competition with state-backed banks. Its valuation, envisioned at about $315 billion after the IPO, has dropped to about $78.5 billion.  On Saturday, Ant proposed to buy back as much as 7.6% of shares in an effort to provide a chance to cut stakes for investors ensnared by a years-long regulatory crackdown at the fintech powerhouse. Alibaba is weighing whether to offer up some of its Ant shares to the buyback, the company said Sunday in an exchange filing. Alibaba hasn’t fared any better. Xi Jinping’s administration targeted the e-commerce pioneer in a crackdown on leading internet platforms, and Alibaba said earlier this year it would split into six major businesses. Alibaba’s market value is $234 billion even after an 8% rally in its US-listed shares Friday with the end of the Ant probe. That’s about $620 billion off of its peak in 2020. Its Hong Kong-listed stock jumped as much as 5.6% on Monday.  “The companies have done their mea culpas and the punishments are over — at least for this series of issues,” said Kendra Schaefer, a partner at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China. Ma’s Hangzhou-based empire was at the heart of a Communist Party smackdown that hit wide swaths of the private sector, from real estate and online education to games and ride-hailing. Xi recalibrated the country’s economy to emphasize “common prosperity” and support for the middle class. The reforms wiped more than $1 trillion from Chinese stocks, with venture capitalists and institutional investors paying a price for the party’s values. While China’s latest measures may signal an easing of the crackdown, the policy priorities of ensuring social stability and national security remain unchanged. “You have to take care of employees and society, and then you can take care of your investors,” said Schaefer. “That’s really the message now.” The lost value for Ma’s properties of more than $850 billion is a sign of how difficult it will be to rebuild trust with international investors. Not only have corporate profits come under pressure as economic growth slowed, but national priorities have shifted in fundamental ways. China’s economic woes are now multiplying, putting pressure on Xi to rebuild support in the private sector. In a downside scenario — with a sharper property slump, slow pace of reforms and more dramatic US-China decoupling — Bloomberg Economics sees China’s economic growth decelerating to 3% by 2030. Along with Ant, the People’s Bank of China levied fines on several other banks and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Ant and Tencent put out their own statements after the fines, suggesting they’ve largely completed the reforms necessary under the country’s regulations. “Authorities clearly have struggled to determine exactly what they want the financial technology space to look like and the role of big technology firms in it,” said Martin Chorzempa, fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “This is why it has taken so long to determine that they are nearing the finish line of the rectification plan with the most important financial technology company in China.” Jack Ma’s fall from grace began in October 2020 when the long-outspoken entrepreneur stepped onto a stage in Shanghai at the Bund Summit to address investors and government officials. With Ant poised to go public in a blockbuster IPO, Ma gave a 20-minute roasting of what he called anachronistic regulations that would stifle innovation in the country. Just days later, officials summoned Ma to the China Securities Regulatory Commission and explained they had found an array of shortcomings in Ant’s business that range from consumer lending and wealth management to online payments. The IPO, which could have raised $35 billion, would have to be called off.  The fintech giant has since been hit with additional regulatory roadblocks and forced to behave more like a traditional bank.  Ant’s profitability tumbled as the company restructured its business to satisfy the demands of China’s watchdogs and shifted its focus from expansion to regulatory compliance. Its net income dropped from double-digit growth in early 2021 to four consecutive quarters of year-on-year decline in 2022. In early 2023, Ma said he would relinquish control over Ant though he will retain about 6.2% of the voting rights based on Bloomberg calculations.      There have been a myriad of setbacks Ant ran into at the height of the two-year tech crackdown. In April 2021, Chinese authorities demanded Ant to turn itself into a financial holding entity but to this day the company hasn’t been able to obtain a license.  Ant was also forced to open up its payments app to competitors and its lending practices have been significantly curbed. The firm was banned from conducting maneuvers that steered users toward loans and other more lucrative services, and its ability to lend was limited with new rules. Consumer loans jointly made with banks — previously a major engine of growth — were split from its Jiebei and Huabei brands.  Ant holds a 50% stake in the consumer-lending business, set up in 2021 as part of its revamp, that has the capacity to issue about 400 billion to 500 billion yuan of loans, based on Bloomberg calculations. Assets under management at Ant’s money-market fund Yu’ebao — once the world’s largest — dropped about 36% to 759 billion yuan ($111 billion) as of September from two years ago. To some extent, Ant’s numbers reflected stagnant growth of China’s broader internet sector pummeled by China’s prolonged, stringent Covid restrictions and tightened scrutiny. Amidst growing economic and regulatory uncertainties, Alibaba has also dwindled and become a shadow of its former self.  Once Asia’s most valuable company, Alibaba’s core domestic commerce business was hammered by an antitrust probe and ultimately a record fine of $2.8 billion in 2021. It is further hamstrung by increasingly fierce competition with rivals including JD.com Inc. and PDD Holdings Inc., and loss of market share in the cloud to state-backed rivals.  After Alibaba posted its third consecutive quarter of single-digit revenue growth, China’s largest e-commerce company unfurled a historical management reshuffle in June. It brought back Ma’s longtime lieutenants Joe Tsai and Eddie Wu to run the empire just months after the firm announced a plan to break into six major units. The pair bears the hope to turn around a company that has struggled to regain its footing since Beijing’s crackdown.  Read More: Alibaba Taps Pro-Crypto Brooklyn Nets Owner to Helm Tech Giant However, investors seemed ambivalent to the shakeup. Alibaba’s stock fell 1.5% the day the new appointments were unveiled, and slipped for the next three trading days. A split Alibaba may also only compound Ant’s woes.  “Alibaba’s breakup plan may do Ant more harm than good,” saidBloomberg Terminal Francis Chan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Its ‘crown jewel’ credit business faces pricing and capital constraints on growth. Credit investigation firms will stand between Ant and its funding partners. Firewalls in its ecosystems limit cross-selling potential. Payment fees are becoming smaller too, while Yu’ebao has lost its appeal to retail investors.” Ma, who remains the spiritual leader of Alibaba, showed up in Hangzhou last month ahead of the management shakeup. Ma went home in early March following a prolonged period of traveling overseas after the government made attempts to persuade Ma to return as a means to showcase authorities’ support for private entrepreneurs. Chinese officials have sought to reassure both foreign and Chinese firms that the country is open for business again, challenged by a bumpy post-covid economic recovery and ongoing tensions with the US over tech supremacy.  That campaign hasn’t been particularly effective. The aggregate VC investment in China has dropped to $3.6 billion in the first four months in 2023, down 50% year-over-year, according to data provider Preqin. “The hefty fine on Ant and Tencent, on one hand, demonstrates Beijing’s commitment to strengthening financial supervision, but on the other hand, it also signals an end to the country’s systematic rectification of so-called internet platform companies,” said Shen Meng, director of Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “The purpose is to stimulate the confidence of private enterprises, but whether it could deliver that result remains to be seen. There might be a gap between Beijing’s expectation and the reality.” From the Archive: What Jack Ma Ceding Control Means for Ant IPO Reboot: QuickTake']\n",

      "['    This week, the AI boom impacted workers across the board — for better or for worse. Will AI take my job? What a fun picnic conversation. About 40% of professional investors responding to the latest Markets Live Pulse survey anticipated that the topic of AI — and the disruption it could cause to the wealth management world — would crop up at their summer cookouts.  The AI boom is touching workers in just about every sector. Law firms are hiring growing numbers of experts in AI. Bridgewater Associates’ co-chief investment officer, Greg Jensen, warned that AI is not particularly well-suited to capture big turning points in the macro economy but has potential in combing and analyzing vast reams of data when paired with some human insight. Officials from US cities to the federal level are beginning to take action. A new law came into effect in New York City this week that prohibits employers from using automated tools to screen candidates in hiring unless the software has undergone an independent review to check for bias against protected groups. US labor representatives expressed concerns to senior Biden administration officials at the White House on Monday, warning about AI’s impact on worker health and privacy while advocating for the labor efficiency benefits. Meanwhile, Japan is exploring the prospects of universal basic income as AI threatens jobs — long a popular idea in certain circles of Silicon Valley. For now, though, there are still some jobs to be had. San Francisco and neighboring San Mateo county added 2,800 jobs in the tech sector, spurred in part by the AI boom. Microsoft Corp. seems primed to ride the wave of AI success to a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. The bank’s analysts also boosted their rating of the Chinese chip sector, citing long-term prospects for AI-linked semiconductors. Elsewhere in China, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research suggested the country can try developing new algorithms to make the industry less dependent on powerful chips. Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk lauded China’s AI advances at a state-backed conference in Shanghai while calling for more oversight of the technology. The US is considering restrictions on China’s access to cloud computing services including those provided by Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft. The move is part of a larger attempt to limit the county’s ability to develop AI capabilities, in line with the US’s restrictions on the export of Western-designed chips.

Senard alluded to China’s decision this week to impose restrictions on exports of gallium and germanium, two metals crucial to the semiconductor, telecommunications and electric-vehicle industries, in an escalation of the country’s tit-for-tat trade war on technology with the US and Europe.

      "['Jack Ma-backed Ant Group Co. is proposing to buy back as much as 7.6% of shares in an effort to retain talent and provide a chance to cut stakes for investors ensnared by a years-long regulatory crackdown at the company.  Each investor would be allowed to sell up to 7.6% of their equity rather than cashing out completely, according to a person familiar with the matter, asking not be identified discussing private details of the arrangement. Ant’s planned repurchase of the equity would value the company at about 567.1 billion yuan ($78.5 billion), it said in a statement on Saturday. That is almost 70% lower than the $280 billion market capitalization it fetched in 2020 for the scrapped initial public offering. Chinese regulators are wrapping up a two-year crackdown on the country’s once-freewheeling technology giants after slapping more than $1 billion of fines on Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd. on Friday. Ant has completed its overhaul ordered by Beijing, pinching profitability and sapping growth at a sprawling platform that spanned lending and insurance to asset management. Giving some money back to shareholders could help Ant shift its focus to building business operations, easing pressure from pre-IPO investors seeking an exit due to its valuation slump. Global funds have grappled with how to assess their investments in Ant made in 2018 when the company was valued at about $150 billion. This is a good opportunity for investors to get some money back as Ant’s profit growth has slowed down significantly, Francis Chan, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said. Minority overseas shareholders might take this opportunity to reduce their stakes, he said.   Silver Lake Management LLC, Warburg Pincus LLC, and Carlyle Group Inc. were among the biggest US backers in that funding round. Others that put money in include Singapore’s GIC Pte, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Temasek Holdings Pte. Ant said it will transfer repurchased stock into the company’s staff incentive plan to attract talent. The individual limited partners of two entities that form the majority of Ant’s shareholders — mostly comprised of Ant executives — have voluntarily decided not sell shares back to Ant out of the long-term commitment to the company, according to the statement. The limited partners also committed to retaining the two dividends in 2022 with Hangzhou Junhan and Hangzhou Junao to enhance the operation’s capital strength. Financial regulators led by the central bank fined Ant and its affiliates a total of 7.12 billion yuan on Friday, ending two years of probe into the company. Tencent was levied a 2.99 billion yuan fine. Tencent and Ant affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. soared in New York trading. A meaningful relaxation of curbs on Ant — one of the most high-profile casualties of President Xi Jinping’s sweeping clampdown on the country’s tech giants — would send a strong signal that policymakers are following through on recent pledges to support the industry. With the regulatory clampdowns out of the way Ant can spend more time building its business and even revive its IPO. Ant said in January it had no plansBloomberg Terminal for an IPO at that time. Still, the company’s Chairman Eric Jing said in 2021 that Ant would eventually go public.  Ant co-founder Ma returned to China in early March after a prolonged period of traveling overseas. The government persuaded him to go back to the mainland as a means to showcase authorities’ support for private entrepreneurs, Bloomberg News had reported.  The move follows Ma’s decision to cede control of Ant in January, holding about 6.2% voting rights after the change. Following that, the Communist Party chief of Hangzhou city praisedBloomberg Terminal Ant for abiding by the party’s leadership, and required local government departments to solve problems raised by the fintech company.  Ant Chairman Says China’s Support for Private Firms Remains More than two years ago, Chinese regulators abruptly halted Ant’s IPO, sending shock waves across global capital markets. New rules have been slapped on the fintech giant, which has operations ranging from consumer lending and wealth management to online payments.  The central bank ordered Ant to fold all financial units into a holding company. It also told the firm to open up its payments app to competitors and sever improper linking of payments with other products including its lending services.  Ant is developing large-language model technology that will power ChatGPT-style services, joining a list of Chinese companies seeking to win an edge in next generation artificial intelligence. The company invested nearly 20.5 billion yuan in research and development last year, doubling its annual spending on such efforts from 2019.']\n",

      "['Since Meta Platforms Inc. launched Threads on Wednesday, millions of users have joined the new social platform that promises “positive, productive conversations” — an apparent swipe at the divisive rhetoric that is common on Twitter and other sites. That promise will be more difficult to keep as the app’s popularity grows — it’s so far drawn 70 million users. That early adopter list includes some connected to the spread of misinformation, disinformation and hate speech on other sites, according to checks by Bloomberg, confirmed by independent researchers.  Already, some of those users are testing the limits of the new app, making false claims about elections, casting doubts on vaccine safety and hurling slurs at the LGBTQ+ community. “We’re already seeing plenty of high-profile accounts that have been known to spread harmful and misleading content,” says Melanie Smith, head of research for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue’s US arm.  Among the new user accounts on Threads: Jack Posobiec, a far-right journalist who has espoused anti-Semitic and white supremacist views; Tim Pool, a YouTube commentator who has been accused of spreading right-wing misinformation; and Chaya Raichik, an anti-LGBTQ influencer and creator of the satirically named Libs of TikTok accounts.  Threads has started with some built-in defense mechanisms for harmful content, as its user policies are the same as Instagram’s. When people click to follow accounts that have been flagged for spreading misinformation in the past, for instance, Threads shows a warning asking if they’re sure. Meta, the biggest social media company which also owns Facebook and Instagram, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it was aware of the Thread accounts from users who had spread disinformation or hate speech on other platforms. Posobiec, for one, has already posted insults of transgender people on Threads and falsely claimed, “The 2020 election was rigged and everyone knows it.” Raichik, under the Libs of TikTok user-name, also took swipes on the new app at transgender people and relished the possibility that her posts might cause controversy. “I love the fact that my existence on this app triggers the left so much,” she wrote shortly after signing up.  At least one member of the Disinformation Dozen, a term used to refer to some of the most influential spreaders of false claims about Covid-19 and its vaccines, have also created accounts. While Dr. Joseph Mercola hasn’t posted any content about vaccines in the days since Threads was launched, his account on Threads had already gathered nearly 7,000 followers. A number of far-right news outlets have also joined the app, with verified accounts for Breitbart News and The Gateway Pundit among them, but haven’t yet posted much. The Threads account for War Room, a show on Real America’s Voice TV run by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon shared a clip on Threads Thursday featuring Naomi Wolf, who accused a prominent pharmaceutical company of committing fraud when it sought emergency authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine.  Several verified accounts attributed to state-run Russian news outlet Sputnik had also set up Threads accounts but most hadn’t yet posted. Meta formally launched Threads on July 6. The platform currently limits the the ways in which a user can discover content. Unlike Twitter, users on Threads cannot search for specific phrases and are forced to view a feed that’s decided by Meta’s algorithms. That means popular users are likely to be promoted widely via the algorithm. For Threads, ISD US’s Smith urges users to exercise caution. “This is a social media app that is owned by Meta who have failed consistently in governing and moderating other platforms that they own,” she says.

      "['Elon Musk sued the law firm that led the court fight to make him complete his takeover of Twitter, saying it took advantage of the company while running up a $90 million bill. Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, among the most profitable firms in the US, exploited a brief, vulnerable period just as Musk was closing the $44 billion deal, according to a complaint filed in San Francisco state court by Musk’s X Corp., now the parent of Twitter. Twitter had agreed to pay Wachtell lawyers on an hourly basis to enforce Musk’s agreement to buy the company when he tried to back out, but the firm violated its ethical duties as well as California law in the final days of its four-month representation when it solicited “gargantuan” bonus fees, according to the complaint.   The lawsuit is something of a role reversal for Musk, who is a defendant in numerous suits alleging that Twitter under his leadership allowed millions in unpaid expenses to pile up from former employees, vendors and landlords while purportedly trying to keep the company financially solvent. Representatives of Wachtell, including William Savitt, who played a lead role in last year’s Delaware Chancery Court fight, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Pity the Lawyers: Twitter-Musk Deal Would End Legal Fee Bonanza Twitter’s legal battle with Musk engaged dozens of lawyers on both sides for months, some charging upwards of $1,000 an hour — leading Columbia University law professor John Coffee to speculate that total legal fees could have exceeded $1 billion if the case had gone to trial.  X Corp. claims that by arranging to bill Twitter its hourly rates instead of taking the case on a contingency basis, Wachtell “undertook absolutely no risk in obtaining its mammoth success fee.” Moreover, the company’s agreement with the law firm “does not even specify the amount of the success fee, let alone any formula or percentage used to arrive at that figure,” according to the complaint. The suit also faults “lame duck” executives at the social media platform went on a legal “spending spree” before Musk took control.  “Fully aware that nobody with an economic interest in Twitter’s financial well-being was minding the store, Wachtell arranged to effectively line its pockets with funds from the company cash register while the keys were being handed over to the Musk Parties,” according to the complaint. The case is X Corp. v. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, CGC-23-607461, California Superior Court (San Francisco).']\n",

      "['Hi everyone, it’s Vlad in Hong Kong, filling in for Jason and Cecilia. I’m taking a break from my full-time job of playing the new Diablo game to regale you with tales of the new Diablo game, but first...  This week’s top gaming news: Diablo IV is going to make Blizzard Entertainment many billions of dollars. I base this on the stranglehold this game has taken on my life, to the exclusion of healthy things like regular sleep and social contact. And the numbers say I’m far from alone: the company issued a press release for Diablo IV sales passing $666 million within fives days of launch, a record. The $70 price has not put fans off. As Cecilia pointed out in her preview last month, this game is also double-dipping on the monetization front. It’s charging for additional and seasonal content just like free-to-play titles without being free to play. Maybe that turns into a bigger point of friction later on, but for now, we don’t care. We just need our fix. The addictive thing about the Diablo series has always been the depth of its gameplay. On the surface, you’re just slicing through waves of monsters. But figuring out the winning combination of skills, weapons and magic-imbued gear — and unearthing that one perfect item to make your strategy work — is the true game of Diablo. It’s a science set dressed in blood-spattered armor. In the case of my Barbarian character, I found a synergy in using his Fury-generating Leap ability to set up his Fury-consuming Whirlwind. With my Rogue-class hero, I combined some boomeranging daggers with the Dash ability, so that I’d quickly run through enemy hordes and have my weapons follow 1.5 seconds later, to devastating effect. The various storylines are paper-thin excuses to dive down another dungeon. Cut scenes and the character animations in them are rudimentary by today’s standards. But those aspects, which have reached cinema-rivaling levels in games like The Last of Us Part II, are no impediment to the enticement of doing just one more task. We know from Blizzard’s other games that fan engagement keeps titles going long after their release. In the case of Diablo, there’s already an ecosystem and a community from the earlier games, and YouTube right now is positively overrun with Diablo IV content. The most popular stuff is advice on how to optimally spend your character’s skill points in order to make them a certifiable death dealer. YouTube, interestingly, has also flooded my personal landing page with Diablo suggestions after I watched just a couple of videos — which I’m interpreting to mean the topic is decently popular. Blizzard has gotten better at dealing with such popularity. Back in the Diablo III days, the game’s requirement to always be online left many players frustrated — by long queue times to join servers or the total inability to play offline. Diablo IV is mercifully quicker to get me connected and into a game, at least on the Asia servers. Now, excuse me, I must get back to my life’s work. My Barbarian still has much to learn about dual-wielding blades without slicing his eyebrows off. If you’re not quite ready to commit your entire life to a game, my tip is Solitairica, a very amusing mashup of solitaire and card battle games. Like Diablo, you go through tiers of antagonists intent on stopping your progress, and you spend in-game gold on upgrades. Unlike Diablo, you can play Solitairica on your phone and complete levels in under a minute.

On Threads, which closely resembles Twitter’s look, people can post text and links and reply to or repost messages from others. The app will let users port over their existing follower lists and account names from Instagram, Meta’s photo and video-sharing app that counts major brands, celebrities and creators among its more than 2 billion users. Threads is currently ranked No. 1 among free apps on Apple Inc’s App Store in the US. “70 million sign ups on Threads as of this morning, ” Zuckerberg said in a post on his Threads account. “That’s way beyond our expectations.”']\n",

The Mumbai-based metals producer will buy 100% of Vedanta Foxconn Semiconductors Pvt. and Vedanta Displays Ltd. from Twin Star, a unit of Vedanta’s ultimate parent Volcan Investments Ltd., billionaire Anil Agarwal’s company said in an exchange filing Friday.  The purchase price is at a face value of 500,000 rupees ($6,043) per share for each unit. In addition, the semiconductor unit includes net operating liabilities of about 40 million rupees incurred toward general or administrative expenses, it said. The deal puts the financing of the ventures on Vedanta Ltd.’s balance sheet, pressuring liquidity that is already tight due to record dividend payouts to parent Vedanta Resources Ltd. The company’s shares initially rose when the venture was announced back in September but plunged days later due to lack of clarity on ownership. The Indian stock market regulator fined the company 3 million rupees last week due to violation of disclosure norms with regards to ownership of the venture. Billionaire’s Chip Dreams Stymied as India Set to Deny Funding Vedanta’s semiconductor push has dragged as the company and partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., widely known as Foxconn, could not get production-ready technology for the 28-nanometer chip they were initially seeking to build. New Delhi has asked Vedanta-Foxconn to reapply for state support to build 40-nanometer chips. Vedanta has previously said Foxconn has secured manufacturing-grade 40nm technology. Even then, the Vedanta-Foxconn venture will have to disclose to the federal government their financing plans comprising equity and debt arrangements as well as their target customers to win crucial state funding for the project. The transaction is expected to be completed in the current quarter, subject to necessary approvals, Vedanta said Friday.']\n",

      "['An artificial-intelligence tool has shown promise at helping doctors fight aggressive brain tumors by identifying characteristics that help guide surgery. The tool — called the Cryosection Histopathology Assessment and Review Machine, or CHARM — studies images to quickly pick out the genetic profile of a kind of tumor called glioma, a process that currently takes days or weeks, said Kun-Hsing Yu, senior author of a report released Friday in the journal Med. Surgeons use detailed diagnoses to guide them while they operate, Yu said, and the ability to get them rapidly could improve patients’ outcomes and spare them from multiple surgeries.  While glioma varies in severity, an aggressive form called glioblastoma can lead to death in less than six months if untreated. Only 17% of people with glioblastoma survive their second year after being diagnosed, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Surgeons use information about the genetic profile of a glioma tumor when deciding how much tissue to remove from a patient’s brain, as well as whether to implant wafers coated in a cancer-fighting drug. Getting that information, however, currently requires time-consuming testing.  Yu and his team of researchers trained a machine-learning algorithm to do the work by showing it pictures of samples gathered during brain surgery, and then checking its work against those patients’ diagnoses. CHARM learned to match or outperform other AI systems at identifying the genetic profile of a tumor.  While the tool is not as accurate as current genetic tests, the computer system can predict a tumor’s profile almost instantly. A swift analysis could let doctors proceed with the right treatment without the added time of scheduling and performing another surgery, Yu said. Using its results alongside other information, “the clinician may be better able to make the right decision on the spot,” said Yu, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, whose lab led the research. CHARM can also tell malignant tumor cells apart from benign cells and identify a tumor’s grade, a measure of how aggressive it is. Those are calls that human pathologists can make during surgery, but the tool could remove the need for a 10-to-15-minute wait, Yu said, or for a pathologist to be on standby during an operation. Though the study showed promise, CHARM still needs to be tested in real-world settings, the researchers said in a news release. Yu’s team’s work is part of a broad set of efforts to use AI to better diagnose and treat cancer. An editorial published in the June issue of the Lancet Oncology highlighted the ability of some systems to accurately identify people at high risk of pancreatic, lung and breast cancer. ']\n",

The company controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani approved a proposal to reduce equity share capital to the extent held by shareholders other than its founders and holding company Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd., it said in an exchange filing on Friday.  “Upon such reduction, these shares held by such shareholders shall stand cancelled and extinguished.,” the filing said. “A consideration of 1,362 rupees ($16.46) per share, determined on the basis of valuation obtained from two reputed independent registered valuers, shall be paid towards the capital reduction.” Reliance Retail is paying a premium over the average price of 866 rupees apiece determined by valuers Ernst & Young Merchant Banking Services LLP and BDO Valuation Advisory LLP to woo shareholders. Reliance Retail’s equity shares are not listed on any stock exchange and there is no recognized market available to shareholders to buy and sell the stock held by them, it said.  Reliance Retail operates 18,040 stores, runs supermarkets, India’s largest consumer electronics chain, a cash-and-carry wholesaler, fast fashion outlets and an online grocery store called JioMart.  Reliance Retail Ventures holds 99.91% of the issued, subscribed and paid-up equity share capital of Reliance Retail. Ambani said in 2019 that Reliance will start the listing process for its telecom arm and retail unit in five years.

      "['China imposed more than $1 billion in fines on tech giants Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., signalling an end to a crackdown on the sector that had wiped out billions in market value and derailed the world’s biggest initial public offering. The People’s Bank of China said financial regulators fined Ant 7.12 billion yuan ($984 million), wrapping up more than two years of probes into the finance technology firm founded by billionaire Jack Ma. Tencent was levied a 2.99 billion yuan fine, according to statements from the central bank Friday. Tencent and Ant affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. soared in New York trading. Investors are betting the fines draw a line under the multi-year crackdown that torpedoed Ant’s planned IPO in 2020 and ensnared some of the nation’s most powerful private firms in sectors from online education to gaming. It paves the way for Ant to revive growth and eventually resurrect plans for an IPO.  “The market likes it because scrutiny looks likely to be over and the fine, though big in absolute terms, is very manageable for such a big company,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee, referring to Ant. The levy is less than the 9.6 billion yuan profit that Ant generated in the December quarter.  Alibaba jumped 8% to $90.55, the biggest gain in more than three months, lifting other New York-listed China stocks. Tencent rose 4%, while TAL Education Group added 7%. The People’s Bank of China said fines were imposed on Ant Group and its subsidiaries in response to violations of laws and regulations in areas including financial consumer protection, payment and settlement business and anti-money laundering obligations. Ant said it has completed the rectification required by China’s financial regulators, according to a company statement. A meaningful relaxation of curbs on Ant — one of the most high-profile casualties of President Xi Jinping’s sweeping clampdown on the country’s tech giants — would send a strong signal that policymakers are following through on recent pledges to support the industry.  The Communist Party’s evolving stance toward the private sector has become one of the most closely watched developments in global markets in recent years, with some observers even calling China’s sprawling internet sector uninvestable. “The decision addresses market concerns about fintech and the overall Internet sector,” Jefferies analysts including Thomas Chong said in a note. They said it “removes overhang” on Alibaba’s shares. Most of the key problems in financial platform enterprises such as Ant Group and Tencent have been rectified, the central bank said in the statement. Ant’s bottom line has eroded since the days it was preparing for the world’s largest IPO in 2020, while its affiliate Alibaba is in the process of splitting into six main businesses from cloud services to meal delivery and logistics. While investors initially cheered the potential creation of value, Alibaba’s shares have come off their 2023 highs and have shed more than $600 billion of their value since the Ant episode began. Fines were also issued to PICC Property & Casualty Co., Postal Savings Bank of China Co. and Ping An Bank Co. given the problems found in previous law enforcement inspections, according to the statement. It’s unclear why Tencent also received a fine. The WeChat operator’s executives have stressed repeatedly since 2022 that their financial businesses are in full compliance with the law, and that they’re in constant dialogue with Beijing. In a statement, Tencent said it sees no adverse impactBloomberg Terminal from the fine, and that it expects China will focus on “normalized regulation” going forward.  Ant co-founder Ma returned to China in early March after a prolonged period of traveling overseas. The government persuaded Ma to go back to the mainland as a means to showcase authorities’ support for private entrepreneurs, Bloomberg News had reported.  The move follows Ma’s decision to cede control of Ant in January, holding about 6.2% voting rights after the change. Following that, the Communist Party chief of Hangzhou city praisedBloomberg Terminal Ant for abiding by the party’s leadership, and required local government departments to solve problems raised by the fintech company.  Ant said in January it has no plansBloomberg Terminal for an IPO now and is focusing on its business. Still, the company’s Chairman Eric Jing said in 2021 that it would eventually go public.  More than two years ago, Chinese regulators abruptly halted Ant’s IPO, sending shock waves across global capital markets. New rules have been slapped on the fintech giant, which has operations ranging from consumer lending and wealth management to online payments.  The central bank ordered Ant to fold all financial units into a holding company. It also told the firm to open up its payments app to competitors and sever improper linking of payments with other products including its lending services.  Still, China’s latest measures don’t represent a return to low-regulation growth, said Martin Chorzempa, fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  “Instead it is the permanent installation of a much higher regulatory barrier for this sector,” he said. “Authorities clearly have struggled to determine exactly what they want the financial technology space to look like and the role of big technology firms in it.” For Ant, it may take longer than anticipated to resume an IPO. Companies can’t list domestically on the country’s so-called A-share market if they have had a change in control in the past three years — or in the past two years if listing on Shanghai’s STAR market, which is geared toward new technology companies. For Hong Kong’s stock exchange, this waiting period is one year.  Ant’s valuation will also look different if it were to go public again. While Ant fetched a valuation of $280 billion pre-IPO, the myriad regulations imposed over the past two-plus years mean it’s now worth a fraction of that, as it’s now more “fin” than “tech.”  Ant could also spin out some of the businesses such as blockchain technology, its database operation known as OceanBase and global services, people familiar have said. Those deliberations are preliminary and could be subject to change.  Ant Could be Valued at Only $22 Billion-$57 Billion: BIBloomberg Terminal  ']\n",

      "['Albert Einstein died in 1955, but the physicist is still a prolific conversationalist. As a chatbot on Character.AI, Einstein has responded to 1.6 million messages, expounding on everything from theories of relativity to pet recommendations: “A cat would be a great choice!”  Silicon Valley is in the throes of a chatbot craze, with companies like OpenAI notching valuations in the billions for devising computer programs that can effectively imitate humans. But none are quite so strange as Character.AI. The artificial intelligence startup, valued at $1 billion, allows people to create their own customized chatbots, impersonating anyone and anything — living or dead or inanimate.  The website, and accompanying app, is one of the most surprising hits of the artificial intelligence craze. People have used it to create more than 16 million different chatbots, or “characters,” and in May, Character.AI said it received close to 200 million visits each month. The Character.AI app, released in the spring, has been downloaded more than 5 million times. The downloads handily outstrip other comparable upstart chat tools like Chai and AI Chatbot, according to SensorTower data.   So far, the bots are popular conversation partners. Character.AI users have sent 36 million messages to Mario, a character based on the Nintendo 64 version of the video game plumber. Raiden Shogun and Ei, which mimics a character in the video game Genshin Impact, has received nearly 133 million messages. The user base, as you might expect, skews young. Other characters include about a dozen versions of Elon Musk, a “kind, gassy, proud” unicorn and “cheese.” “I joke that we’re not going to replace Google. We’re going to replace your mom,” co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Noam Shazeer said during an interview this spring, speaking from the startup’s sunny office in downtown Palo Alto. The CEO quickly added, “We don’t want to replace anybody’s mom.” But as Character.AI brings in funding and users, it’s also surfacing thorny questions about the future of AI tools. For example, the site already hosts 20 different versions of Mickey Mouse, Walt Disney Co.’s precious intellectual property — raising the specter of legal issues. And the profusion of impersonators — of both real and fake celebrities — also presents a more fundamental quandary: Who owns an ersatz personality on the AI-supercharged internet?  Shazeer and Character.AI co-founder Daniel De Freitas met while working at Google, and decided to start Character.AI in 2021. Despite the goofiness of the company, both are serious AI industry figures. Shazeer is a co-author of “Attention Is All You Need,” a breakthrough 2017 research paper that ushered in a new era of natural-language processing. And De Freitas created a chatbot project called Meena, which was renamed and publicized as LaMDA, Google’s now-famous conversation technology. That pedigree brings them close to celebrity status in the world of AI (as much as such a thing is possible).  The idea behind the startup was to create an open-ended system that lets people mold their technology into whatever they wanted. The pair speak hyperbolically about their goal for the startup, which, as De Freitas puts it, is to give every person access to their own “deeply personalized, super intelligence to help them live their best lives.”  The pitch was compelling enough to investors that 16 months after its founding, the company   raised $150 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz. This summer, Character.AI has seen wide enough adoption that service interruptions have become a  semi-regular issue. Several times while reporting this story, the website wouldn’t load, and on a recent morning, while trying to create a character that I envisioned as a giant, helpful banana, the iOS app suddenly interrupted me with a warning screen that said its servers were “currently under a high load” and I’d have to wait. Character.AI sees an opportunity here — one that’s led to the startup’s only revenue-generating effort so far. Users can pay to get around some disruptions. In May, the company rolled out a $10-per-month subscription service called c.ai+ that it says will let users skip so-called waiting rooms, and get access to faster message generation, among other perks.  “It’s actually benefitting everyone involved,” Shazeer said, noting that paying users will get better service, which in turn subsidizes the rest of the program. But as for future revenue plans, he said, “It’s really just a baby step.” Like many AI companies that have raised millions, details on its ultimate business model are still opaque. The industry may have more immediate concerns. Right now, most chatbot technology comes with the potential for misuse. On Character.AI, consider a character named simply Psychologist — whose profile image is a stock photo meant to depict a smiling therapist sitting on a couch holding a folder. The bot had received 30 million messages as of early July. Its opening line is, “Hello, I’m a Psychologist. What brings you here today?”  Stephen Ilardi, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Kansas who studies mood disorders, says the positioning is worrisome. A psychologist is definitionally a medical professional trained to help people manage mental illness, he said, “and this thing almost certainly is not that.” There’s also the potential for legal questions, which have   followed other startups that learn from and repurpose existing content. For starters, Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington, thinks there could be issues related to the use of copyrighted images on the site (users can upload an image of their choosing to accompany the chatbots they create). And then there’s the fact that the company enables impersonation at scale, allowing anyone to hold hours-long conversations with, say, Taylor Swift, or a whole host of copyrighted fictional characters.  But there are robust legal protections for parodies, and companies will have an incentive not to interfere with people’s online interactions with their favorite characters. It can be a bad look for a brand to take legal action against a popular service. “Fans are involved,” Said said, “and you don’t want your fans seeing the litigation side of your brand management.” Shazeer said the company does have a lawyer and responds to any requests it receives to take down content. A Character.AI spokesperson said that the company has received a small number of requests for the removal of avatar images, and has complied. Additionally, to keep users grounded in reality, the website displays a message at the tops of screens, “Remember: Everything Characters say is made up!” It’s still early days for tech’s chatbot obsession. Some experiments have already gone badly — for example, the National Eating Disorders Association suspended its chatbot after it started giving problematic weight-loss advice. But the rapid rise of services like Character.AI — along with ChatGPT, Inflection AI’s Pi and others — suggest that people will be increasingly conversing with computers. The promise of having a smart AI friend or assistant is compelling to both investors and consumers. Mike Ananny, an associate professor of communication and journalism at the University of Southern California, views custom chatbots almost as a new art form. Ananny compares Character.AI to fan-fiction, a twist on the longstanding, varied genre where people create fictional narratives based on existing characters from media like movies or TV shows. Whether people are chatting with actual people or chatbots “is not the interesting point,” Ananny said. “It’s ‘What’s the feeling?’ ‘What’s the aesthetic?’” In the end, he said, “It kind of doesn’t matter if they’re real or not.”']\n",

      "['The European Central Bank’s cybersecurity stress test next year won’t have a direct impact on capital requirements, limiting the exercise’s potential repercussions for investor payouts. The test will be a learning experience for lenders and the supervisor, ECB officials said on a call with bank executives last week, according to people briefed on the meeting. Even bad results for participating banks won’t automatically translate into higher capital requirements, the officials said, though they didn’t rule an indirect impact. The ECB indicated on the call that the test will simulate an attack targeting the databases underlying the banks’ main operating systems, and that it intends to send out test documents to banks around November, said the people, who asked for anonymity to discuss the private information. An ECB spokesman declined to comment. The supervisor is currently laying the groundwork for its first cyber stress test of Europe’s banks, to map what it sees as rising risks to financial stability emanating from criminal acts such as data theft and cyber attacks. Slated for the beginning of next year, the test will assess how the region’s lenders would respond to a potentially crippling attack on their IT. Stress tests are among the most important tools for the ECB to determine how resilient banks are to various shocks. Bad results in its biennial exam of banks’ ability to withstand an economic downturn generally lead to higher capital requirements, restricting lender’s ability to pay dividends or carry out share buybacks.

While that test didn’t have a direct impact on capital requirements either, the ECB later said that it did contribute to its decision to increase the minimum amount of capital several banks have to hold by informing its annual assessment of the risks those banks are facing. The cyber stress test will be “a new exercise, and we will devote quite a significant amount of time and resources to it,” ECB banking supervision head Andrea Enria said in an interview with a Lithuanian newspaper in March.

      "[' If you’re not already a fan of sending your friends and family audio messages, I’m here to tell you to get over it (and Apple is, too). But first…  Three things you need to know today:    • Meta’s Threads app drew millions seeking a Twitter alternative• Tesla and Chinese rivals signaled a truce in the EV price war• Amazon’s iRobot deal is getting an in-depth EU probe Controversial question: If you picked up your phone today and saw that your friend had texted you a 10-minute voice memo, how would you feel? Offended? Thrilled? Terrified? “There’s no better way to tell someone that your time is more valuable than theirs than to send a voice note,” Andrew Yeung, a product lead at Alphabet Inc., wrote in a semiviral tweet (shortly before all the cool kids  moved over to Threads). If this is your stance, I hope you’re prepared for a slow but eventual defeat. In the US, 30% of adults use voice messages at least weekly, and that percentage rises to 43% when you limit the group to those under 30 years old, according to a recent poll by YouGov for Vox. Apple Inc.’s designers are working on making the feature easier to use, which means more people will use it. The company will roll out a new version of the iPhone’s operating system in the fall that will include auto-transcription of audio notes sent in iMessage. That should erase one of the major complaints from users: that it’s hard to find the time to listen to them. Voice memos have long been a staple of WhatsApp, especially in regions like India and Latin America. (WhatsApp lets users play them back at 1.5x or 2x speed to save listeners’ time.) Bumble and Hinge now offer voice messaging in their dating apps, seemingly because they understand one clear benefit of the medium (flirting). That’s just the practical argument for voice messages. Let me make an emotional one: These little audio clips, when deployed correctly, can be entertaining and evocative ways to connect with people you love. My friends and I are voice memo converts, and we’ve used them for all sorts of situations: At its best, a 10-minute voice memo is a mini podcast from someone special, recorded just for you, that you can listen to whenever you want. The broader lesson is that people who think voice memos violate some cherished communication rituals are kidding themselves. When it comes to digital habits, we’re worse than goldfish. We’re constantly inventing new norms in response to whatever ideas Apple or Meta Platforms Inc. cooks up for us. Remember life before read receipts? Now we mourn being left on read, a pain that’s barely 10 years old. Software developers popularized the idea of “reacting” to a message with a thumbs up or a heart. At first, I thought this was useless; now I feel vaguely rude if I end an exchange without one. (To go further back in the annals of telecommunication trends, there’s a bewildering and hilarious oral history about how people used answering machines to coordinate bar-hopping in 2002.) Tech changes our habits, and then we can’t imagine them ever changing again — until the next product tweak and the next. For now, consider sending your loved one a voice message. AI-driven gains could propel Microsoft to join Apple in the elite category of stocks with a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Once one of the highest-rated stocks on Wall Street, Alphabet is getting a cooler reception from analysts after rallying 35% this year. US Treasury officials visited Hong Kong in June to urge the city’s central bank, financial institutions and other groups to curb the flow of advanced American-made technology into Russia, the Nikkei reported. After months of painful job cuts, companies in San Francisco’s tech sector stepped up hiring in May, spurred in part by an AI boom, according to a new report. EU officials are working to narrow the scope of export controls that China announced this week on two key metals used in semiconductors, solar panels and electric vehicles.

      "['A sluggish market for initial public offerings and a steady appetite for growth capital means private credit has an opportunity to play a vital role in bridging that gap for burgeoning tech firms, according to Viral Patel, Blackstone Credit’s global head of technology investing. Patel spoke with Bloomberg’s Ellen Schneider about a rift in valuations between buyers and sellers, along with Blackstone’s eye on long-term tailwinds and defensive investments. Comments have been edited and condensed. The take-private part of our pipeline continues to be fairly active.  Sponsor-to-sponsor activity we’ve seen to-date continues to be muted because of bid-ask spreads. There’s a valuation gap between buyers and sellers. A lot of companies are still trading meaningfully off their highs, ands we continue to see sponsors looking at those assets as a way to find attractive companies that were historically unattainable.  With the market rallying a bit this year, it’s little bit slower, but we have an active part of our pipeline focused on that and sponsors are continuing to call on it. One of the biggest issues the tech sector faces right now is access to capital, the way they it had historically.  Valuations are down significantly from their peaks and that’s directly correlated to the rate environment. What that means for companies looking for access to capital on the equity side is, you’re looking at a down round. Second is broad macroeconomic uncertainty. One of the things the sector is seeing is sales cycles are taking longer right now. So, all company buying decisions at the customer level are undergoing more scrutiny. Third has been a balance between growth and profitability. Historically, a lot of these companies have been driving their operating models focused more on growth, less on profitability. As it relates to lending to tech companies, the credit story has gotten more attractive because what we’re seeing is that even though growth is slowing, it’s still growing. At Blackstone, we focus on mature late-stage businesses. We’re fundamentally cash flow-based investors. We don’t participate on the core venture lending or early-stage growth lending side. One of the key themes that we’re seeing play out across the tech sector is consolidation. There’s been a lot of point solutions that were created over the last decade, but customers are looking more for companies that can provide a suite of solutions, versus just one singular one. The reason private debt has become more interesting is that historically, a lot of these businesses have been rated. Private credit provides confidentiality and efficiency because companies don’t need to get a rating, and there’s certainty of execution.  Our platform is primarily focused on underwriting cash flow-based loans, so while we do have some ARR loans in our book, it is not a major focus for our platform.  We’ve focused on ARR loans that are in larger, faster growing companies with strong gross margins and unit economics, so they can shift into an Ebitda-based loan. The thesis behind it is as companies slow their top-line growth, they reduce the amount of spend on marketing and sales, and drive profitability margins up. The businesses that we focused on can reduce the cost load to get to that Ebitda break-even point. The IPO markets will continue to be an attractive option for tech companies.  There’s a healthy backlog of businesses that are waiting to go back once the market opens up and you could see some more IPOs in the second half of 2023. I think the question is how deep is the bid in the markets today for an IPO of size? Most of the deals that have happened recently have been on the smaller side. That said, there’s a lot of private equity capital and private growth equity capital that can continue to fund these businesses for a longer period.  I don’t think these businesses will feel the pressure to go public sooner than they have to. They have a lot of alternatives to stay private and wait until it feels like it’s the right time and valuation environment to go public in. One is cybersecurity. If you think about the threats that are facing corporations today, those are ever increasing, they’re not going away. We like cybersecurity because it’s highly defensive, it’s difficult to turn off your cybersecurity software. It’s not something a company is going to do lightly. Another area we like is software companies focused on the increasing volume of data among corporates. Corporations are creating and using data more than ever. But in order to get the most out of that data, they need to be able to organize and analyze it. A lot of companies provide software and tools to help do that. We think that’s a trend that’s going stick around, so we’re investing heavily behind that. We tend to avoid lower-quality tech businesses that are slower growing and have poor unit economics and big components of their businesses that are non-recurring or services-oriented that don’t have the ability to drive profitability and margin.']\n",

      "['The co-founder of digital telecom provider Circles is stepping down from the company’s management team, part of an internal staffing overhaul aimed at shedding costs after years of attempts to take on Singapore’s incumbent services. Abhishek Gupta, who helped build the business over the past seven years, will now take on a non-executive role and it’s unclear what his future duties include, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information is private. While Gupta never formally adopted the CEO’s title, he was regarded as the public face of a company that once sought to take on Singtel in Singapore, and oversaw its business-facing arm Circles X.  Co-founder Rameez Ansar was identified as chief executive officer at an industry event last month. Gupta’s shift, which hasn’t been previously reported, underscores the upheaval underway at a startup that once harbored ambitions of disrupting the staid, carefully controlled Singaporean wireless industry. The startup denied in a statement on Saturday that Gupta’s role had been reduced.  “Abhishek is not taking on a non-executive role or a non-executive director role. He remains a co-founder with the same title and is strongly vested in the business,” a spokesperson said in the emailed statement. The management reshuffle is part of a new project titled “Brave New World,” or a move by top investors to give Ansar 180 days to turn the company around, the people said. Warburg Pincus Makes ‘Substantial Investment’ in Circles.LifeBloomberg Terminal Under the project, announced to staff early May, Circles has steadily cut jobs across departments including human resources, engineering, marketing and Circles X, according to the people. Some other key executives, including the chief growth officer, have left the company, according to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. Circles, which was launched in 2016, offers digital mobile services including voice, data, roaming and international calls. Hailed as a disruptor to the traditional telco market, it initially grabbed market share from incumbents like Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., StarHub Ltd. and M1 Ltd. by offering customers lower prices, cheaper data, no-contract plans and the freedom to manage their own mobile plans digitally. Early on, it splashed out on bold marketing campaigns, mocking established rivals for their long-term contracts, poor customer service and expensive data options. The company said it reached 5% market share in Singapore in 2019 and also has operations in Taiwan, Indonesia and Japan. Warburg Pincus LLC said it made a “substantial investment” in Circles in 2020, without disclosing the financial terms. Competitors soon slashed their prices and launched similar mobile plans to Circles, and several have upgraded their digital offerings to allow customers to manage their accounts through an app. As it struggled to tackle the intensifying competition, Circles tried to diversify by launching products including an events app which allowed users to book movie tickets, ands a software platform to allow players to launch their own digital telco. Southeast Asian internet companies are facing growing pressure from investors to slash expenses and turn profitable amid an uncertain macroeconomic climate. Singapore’s Grab Holdings Ltd. and Sea Ltd. have eliminated thousands of jobs, fighting to reduce costs and win back investors in a climate where growth is potentially slowing amid a higher rate of inflation and rising interest rates.']\n",

      "['In late June, workers at a General Motors Co. Ultium electric-vehicle plant confronted a startling sight: A defective battery was on fire. The workers raced to put it out, and were able to do so, according to the fire department near the facility in Lordstown, Ohio. While no one faced life-threatening injuries, two people were sent to the hospital for smoke inhalation — adding tension to an already strained relationship between the plant’s workers and its managers.  The United Auto Workers union and Ultium Cells LLC, which is jointly owned by GM and Korea’s LG Energy Solution, are in the midst of negotiating a labor contract. At the same time, the UAW is hammering out a new, four-year pact with GM and the two other traditional Detroit carmakers. Labor and management already were battling over wages, and the union wants better safety protections following multiple accidents at the plant. “It’s not just the low pay, these jobs are often dangerous,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a video that aired July 5. “This is our defining moment. It’s time to build an EV industry that puts workers first.” The outcome of the talks could have a far-reaching impact. The US is building up its EV industry and will need to attract thousands of workers. Meanwhile, automakers and their battery partners are under pressure to control costs as they expand. Ultium’s vice president of operations, Tom Gallagher, wrote in a newspaper editorial this week he was “excited” the UAW had organized the Ultium plant and that he “looks forward” to working with the union. “A competitive, forward-thinking collective bargaining agreement can provide a model for unionization of other US battery cell manufacturing plants and extended electric vehicle supply chain,” he wrote in the July 2 Tribune Chronicle, which serves the Mahoning Valley area in northeastern Ohio where the Ultium plant is located. The company declined to respond to specific union allegations. “Safety is a top priority each day,” Ultium spokesperson Dallis Tripoulas wrote in an email to Bloomberg News, adding that the plant now has four union members as safety representatives.  Discussions are expected to intensify over the next few months both at Ultium and with the three legacy Detroit automakers. There’s about a 90% chance of a strike targeting one of the three carmakers, and a possibility for a second strike at another, according to an analysis by John Murphy, a Bank of America analyst covering the auto industry. The new labor deal will probably push labor costs up by 30%, he said in a recent report. Negotiations between UAW and automakers are more complex than usual. The union already has labor agreements with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV, but those pacts don’t apply to their newer, electric-battery plants — like Ultium — because they’re usually joint ventures involving outside partners. UAW had to organize Ultium from scratch and won the election last year. The union also is learning about the EV industry as it forges deals. Battery-cell plants are more like chemical factories than conventional auto-production facilities, where injuries are more likely to be from machinery accidents or repetitive tasks.  A year ago, a contractor at the Ultium plant was crushed by an automated crane while working inside the plant, suffering serious injuries, according to Travis Eastham, the local fire-station chief. The worker was hospitalized for months and later died of his injuries, Eastham said in a phone interview.  At the time, the company confirmed a subcontractor was injured at the plant, but declined to discuss the incident further. In a white paper, the union said Ultium worker Gavin Currey was sprayed with toxic gas in early May while working in an area that extracts a poisonous electrolyte compound from battery cells. Currey said in the paper he experienced minor burns to his face and a union official said he was unable to work for three days. Another worker, Mandy McCoy, told the union she saw a colleague put toxic waste in a garbage can, emitting fumes that made her and a coworker nauseous. McCoy said her colleague was taken to the hospital. The Ultium spokesperson declined to comment on any specific incidents or the findings of the white paper.  In all, the union said 22 workers suffered injuries and missed a total of 200 days of work. That equates to 2.2 injuries per hundred workers — twice the average for battery plants, according to Nellie Brown, Director of Workplace Health and Safety Programs at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Ultium has paid $68,000 in fines in the past year to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, double what SK Battery’s plant in Georgia has paid out over the same period. They were for non-injury claims, such as not providing workers with safety data sheets, which explain the nature of chemicals they are handling and include first-aid procedures. There are four other cases open, according to OSHA. The agency won’t release details on those cases because the investigations are ongoing, but a spokesperson said they aren’t related to injuries.  In early May, six battery factory workers in the plant’s electrolyte-mixing department refused to work until the company installed a safety shower in their work area. They were suspended. Ultium offered them a chance to return to work and move to a different area, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg.  A union official said a shower has been installed and two of the workers have gone back. The Ultium spokesperson said the company has an agreement with the six workers to return to work, but declined to say if the workers are back.  UAW’s Fain is pushing to include Ultium workers in a master-labor agreement the union already has with the major Detroit car companies. He’s said he believes the automakers are using joint-venture structures, where those agreements don’t apply, to cut pay. Workers in engine plants, who are covered by the master-labor agreement, make more than $30 an hour, while battery workers at Ultium max out at about $22. The automakers disagree with that characterization. GM partnered with LG to obtain much-needed expertise, Gerald Johnson, GM’s executive vice president of global manufacturing, said in an interview last month. Automakers stand to profit from EV manufacturing, in part, because of incentives in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. GM said it expects to earn $300 million in tax credits this year and aims to build 1 million EVs a year by 2025, which would yield between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion if they all sell out. The union wants its cut. “A just transition must include standards for our members and future workers,” Fain said. Otherwise “taxpayers are going to continue to funnel over $1 billion a year to Ultium despite their paying poverty wages and having horrifying health and safety conditions.”']\n",

      "['A law that props up the news industry has turned Canada into the latest battleground for global tech giants that are pushing back against governments trying to curb their dominance. The Online News Act, passed into law last month by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, requires companies including Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to negotiate commercial deals with local news organizations for featuring news on their platforms. It’s meant to help outlets that have seen their advertising revenue decimated in the digital era. But strong opposition from tech firms — including Meta’s intention to permanently end the availability of news on Facebook and Instagram in Canada, and Google’s plan to remove links to Canadian news — is more than just a reaction to the law itself. The platforms may see it as a precedent-setter for jurisdictions from California to Indonesia that are trying to force them to pay for news. “It’s a proxy battle for them,” said Jason Kint, chief executive officer at Digital Content Next, a New York-based trade association representing media companies including News Corp., Politico and Bloomberg. “Whatever they do in Canada, they’re probably doing it more for their public policy interests in the US, UK and elsewhere.” The California Journalism Preservation Act has advanced to the Senate in Meta’s home state, where the company has also threatened to pull news content. Other countries are also talking about legislation governing news and technology platforms, including Indonesia’s regulation on publishers’ rights, Brazil’s fake-news law and the UK’s digital competition bill. News removal isn’t just a threat. Meta blocked news briefly in Australia in response to that country’s News Media Bargaining Code, a model for the Canadian bill. Alphabet shut down Google News in Spain for nearly eight years after it passed a law requiring news aggregators to pay publishers; it resumed the service last year following an update to the copyright legislation. Canada’s legislation presents a major threat to tech firms because it’s “closer to home,” Kint said.  Trudeau has so far stood firm. This week, he hit back at Meta by suspending government advertising on Facebook and Instagram. But the hostilities between Silicon Valley and Ottawa have also highlighted a key criticism of the law. If powerful players such as Google and Facebook won’t link to news sites in Canada, the biggest losers could be innovative news startups that rely on them to reach new audiences.  “This is an existential risk. It feels like a bomb has just been put in the center of our business models,” said Jeanette Ageson, publisher of The Tyee, a British Columbia-based news website. “Smaller digital players would be disproportionately affected by a news block because we don’t have the name brand recognition that the bigger news brands have.”  Some of the law’s biggest proponents are legacy newspaper publishers.   A possible news ban on the platforms has already led to a suspension of all new hiring and community launches at Village Media Inc., an Ontario-based digital publisher that has dozens of websites, employs nearly 100 journalists and says its mission is to “save local news”. About 18% of Village Media’s traffic comes from Facebook and about 32% from Google platforms.  “Pulling news would have a devastating impact on the whole sector, in particular digital publishers like us that are growing,” said Jeff Elgie, Village Media’s CEO. If the platforms’ news block becomes permanent, “I wouldn’t see a viable, investable business anymore.”  Bloomberg News also uses social media and search platforms to distribute content. Meta and Alphabet have argued that they would be unfairly forced to pay for content that has little to no economic value for them — and that news publishers already benefit by getting web traffic, which brings advertising and subscription revenue, via their platforms.  Meta experimented with paying publishers directly for journalism, but has changed strategy to focus more on short-form video entertainment and less on news. Given regulatory pressures around the world, CEO Mark Zuckerberg no longer believes investing in news is worth the trouble, according to a person familiar with the matter. Posts with links to news articles make up less than 3% of what people see in their Facebook feed, according to the company. While the enforceability of the Canadian law is now in question, given the platforms’ threats, one other thing is clear: If a compromise can be reached that allows news companies to receive payments from Meta and Google, it may help stem, or at least slow, the decline of the Canadian media sector that saw 450 outlets close between 2008 and 2021.  Australia’s media bargaining code led to “massive changes,” with more than A$200 million ($133.5 million) raised annually, according to Rod Sims, a professor at Australian National University and former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, an agency that drafted the legislation. Sims said newsrooms expanded, journalism job postings went up, and “anecdotally, a lot of journalists said there’s never been a better time to be a journalist.” But Canada has opened an opportunity for tech giants to set new expectations for other governments hoping for similar outcomes to Australia, said Michael Geist, a University of Ottawa law professor who’s opposed to the Trudeau law. “Everyone always refers to Australia, and as there are these trends globally, they may well say, ‘We want people thinking of the Canadian example.’”']\n",

      "['Apple Inc. is planning a retail launch of its Vision Pro headset with appointments and in-store promotion in select US markets early next year, underscoring the niche and complex nature of the mixed-reality device.  The company will designate special areas in the stores with seating, headset demo units and tools to size accessories for buyers. While the device will be sold at all of Apple’s roughly 270 US locations, the company is planning the sections for the Vision Pro initially at stores in major areas — such as New York and Los Angeles — before rolling them out nationwide, according to people with knowledge of the plans.  Apple said it will offer the headset in other countries at the end of 2024. The company is discussing the UK and Canada as two of its first international markets with Asia and Europe soon after, although a final decision hasn’t been made, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing internal matters. Apple engineers are working to localize the device for France, Germany, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, the people said. Apple will also sell the Vision Pro through its US web store in early 2024 before expanding online elsewhere. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the rollout. The headset, unveiled in June, is Apple’s most significant product since the Apple Watch, but the $3,500 price point, unclear use cases, limited mixed-reality content selection and the nascent nature of the technology means it will appeal to a small group of enthusiasts at the outset. To push the category to more consumers, Apple is working on a cheaper model as well as a second-generation Pro version for release by 2026. The wearable device mixes virtual and augmented reality, meaning it can engross a user in content with high-resolution displays — ideal for video watching — or put applications on top of the wearer’s field of view, letting messages and notifications pop up without overwhelming the person. Apple will ask in-store buyers to make an appointment to purchase the Vision Pro. That follows a strategy the company used for the Apple Watch in 2015. The driving force behind the idea is to ensure customers walk out with a product that fits properly. If applicable, the company will ask users for their vision prescription for lens inserts via an online portal. To determine the right light seal — the component that keeps light out of a wearer’s field of view — Apple is developing an iPhone app that will scan a person’s head as well as a physical machine. Online purchasers will similarly be asked to upload their prescription data and use the face scan app to determine accessory sizing.  People familiar with the retail launch say it will be Apple’s most complex debut to date and will require sorting out tricky supply chain logistics, training salespeople how to set up the device and teaching customers how to use it. To that end, the company doesn’t anticipate partnering with third-party resellers to offer the Vision Pro until at least 2025. Most stores will feature only one to two demo units at the outset due to limited supply and the high cost of the devices.  Years ago, Apple anticipated building as many as high-single-digit millions of units in its first year before paring back expectations to closer to 1 million. Ahead of its introduction, Apple sliced that number to about 900,000 units. The Financial Times reported earlier this week that the goal has been cut in half due to the device’s complex manufacturing process. The Vision Pro has dual 4K micro-OLED displays, in addition to curved internal electronics and dual chips.  Beyond the device itself, the accompanying accessories also present logistical challenges, the people familiar with the process said. The company has said it will offer head bands and light seals in multiple different sizes, which retail stores will need to carry. Different consumers may need vastly different sizes, meaning stores will need to offer extra accessories if, say, a person wants to let someone else try their device or if their face size changes. Apple has partnered with Carl Zeiss AG to make the optional prescription lenses for the device, and Apple stores will need to keep in stock hundreds or thousands of lenses. The task becomes more complex in cases where a user may have different prescriptions for each eye.  Outside of the light seal and head band, the Vision Pro includes a similar charger to the one included with the MacBook Pro as well as the two-hour external battery pack. During testing of the device, Apple determined that some people with smaller body sizes and heads would struggle to wear the headset for more than half an hour or so, the amount of time the company let media members test the Vision Pro after its introduction. Apple looked to offset that issue with the recent development of a second strap that sits across the top of a user’s head. The design of that accessory isn’t finalized. Apple has also investigated how the Vision Pro would fit for people wearing cultural apparel, such as a hijab. Aware that some customers may not wear clothes with pockets capable of storing the battery pack, the company has considered asking accessory makers to create shoulder-worn pouches. Other accessories could eventually be sold to protect the device. The company has found that the front of the headset could be prone to scratches, but it will likely outsource screen protectors to third-party makers as it does with its other products. Another concern: the front glass cracking if a user walks into a wall or an object. To help prevent such incidents, Apple has built in alerts to deter people from wearing the device while walking at certain speeds.  For those traveling fast — such as in a car or airplane — the company has developed what is known as Travel Mode. This allows a passenger to be fully immersed in virtual reality without limitations.

      "['Taiwan’s exports plunged in June at the fastest pace since 2009, exacerbating concerns about the slump in global demand for electronics and its impact on the economy.  Overseas shipments plummeted 23.4% to $32.3 billion last month compared to a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said Friday. That was far worse than expectations of a 13.5% decline in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and was much more severe than the 14.1% fall recorded in May.  It also marked the fastest pace of declines since August 2009. Imports dropped 29.9% from a year earlier, following a 21.7% tumble in May. The economy’s trade balance was nearly $6 billion. Taiwan, which is export-dependent, has struggled with lackluster overseas appetite for technological goods — including for semiconductors, a key product.  “Taiwan’s first half exports dropped 18% year-on-year, the worst in almost 14 years, due to cooling of the global economy and a higher base,” Beatrice Tsai, the finance ministry’s chief statistician, said in a briefing.  The finance ministry cited weak demand for integrated circuits, inflation and interest-rate hikes that have meant a stagnating global economy, as well as a high base of comparison with last year. Michelle Lam, economist at Societe Generale, said it was too early to determine whether exports had bottomed out since June is “not the peak season” for consumer electronics. “We still need further data to see if usual demand comes back around the third quarter.” The demand problem seems to be improving elsewhere. South Korea in June registered its first trade surplus in 16 months, although exports still declined in the month. ']\n",

The Multichain protocol tweeted on Friday that “lockup assets” have been “moved to an unknown address abnormally,” and added that “the team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating.” BlockSec later wrote on Twitter that the tokens have now been distributed across six crypto wallets but refrained to hypothesizing about the cause. Multichain is one of a number of services that try to make disparate digital ledgers interoperable. Such so-called crypto bridges have proved to be vulnerable to hackers, who stole about $2 billion from them last year alone, based on estimates from Chainalysis. The Multichain protocol — a decentralized application that deploys self-executing, software-based smart contracts — advised against accessing its services and told users to revoke contract approvals related to the bridge. In late May, Multichain said it had “experienced multiple issues” and was unable to contact its chief executive officer — whom it identified as Zhaojun — to “obtain the necessary server access for maintenance.” The total value of assets locked on Multichain tops $1.2 billion, making it the third largest crypto-sector bridge, according to data from DefiLlama. Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, founder of the largest crypto exchange Binance, tweeted that it “looks like another hack” has hit Multichain. Multichain’s native token MULTI slid 17% to $2.59 as of 7:53 a.m. in London on Friday, according to figures from CoinGecko.']\n",

      "['EFishery, co-founded by a former resident of a poor Jakarta neighborhood, became a rare Indonesian unicorn after raising $200 million in fresh funding. The agritech startup’s value hit $1.4 billion after a Series D round led by Abu Dhabi’s 42XFund, more than tripling its previous value of $410 million in 2022, according to Chief Executive Officer Gibran Huzaifah. Malaysia’s state pension fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, ResponsAbility Investments AG and 500 Global also joined in the round, along with existing backers including Northstar Group, Temasek Holdings Pte and SoftBank Group Corp. The company, which serves 70,000 fish and shrimp farmers in Indonesia, crossed the billion-dollar mark in a year when layoffs, CEO resignations and plummeting valuations in the tech sector have dominated headlines. Slowing economies, rising interest rates and higher levels of inflation have prompted venture investors globally to pull back. It plans to use the funds to expand in Indonesia and India before pursuing an initial public offering in the US or Indonesia in two years, the CEO said in an interview. “We’d like to be a global leader over the next five years and do an IPO at some point,” he said. “The earliest would be in 2025.” Huzaifah, 33, grew up near slums in eastern Jakarta, the son of a construction site foreman and a homemaker. His mother, who never finished high school, urged him to study. And he excelled academically, eventually enrolling in Bandung Institute of Technology, a local elite university known for producing engineers. But as he entered the university, his family’s financial situation took a turn for worse after his father lost his job. Without money from home or acquaintances in a new city, he had to find a shelter to sleep every night. It was sometimes the campus, sometimes a mosque, he said. Once, he didn’t eat for three days. Then by chance, Huzaifah, a biology major, attended a class on aquaculture. He became fascinated by the professor’s lectures on catfish breeding. Convinced that aquaculture was the future of food — and more importantly, his path to escape destitution — he immediately rented a pond to farm catfish. Three years later, in 2012, he was operating 76 ponds. During that time, he experienced firsthand the industry’s challenges, such as minuscule profit margins caused by substantial feeding costs and low fish prices demanded by middlemen buying his catch. With help from a friend with a technology background, he built a prototype automatic feeder using Internet-of-Things technology to eliminate the problem of over- or under-feeding fish. Then in 2013, he launched eFishery. His approach was two-pronged: do something you understand and don’t follow the crowd.  The company’s business has since evolved to include a marketplace for fish and shrimp farmers and buyers. It also works with financial institutions to provide financing to farmers. After the latest funding round, Huzaifah and his co-founder’s stake is worth more than $100 million each. But Huzaifah said his life hasn’t changed much. Still, “it feels good because I don’t need to worry about the financial troubles I had growing up,” he said.']\n",

      "['China plans to require online platforms to clamp down on cyberbullying on social media and in live broadcasts, after a public outcry erupted over reports of a harassment incident that led to a woman killing herself.  Online service providers must step up their monitoring and the timely removal of cyberbullying content, defined as illegal and harmful information that targets specific individuals, invade their privacy or impact their physical or mental health, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in draft guidelines published on Friday for public feedback.  If platform operators fail to comply, authorities could require them to suspend content updates. Firms can also be penalized according to existing laws that ensure online security and protect personal data, regulations that stipulate fines of up to 1 million yuan ($138,100). These guidelines come after a woman in Wuhan reportedly killed herself in June, after online users incessantly criticized her for not looking her part as a mother who just lost her son in an accident with her neat outfit and makeup. The episode, reported by many including state-run China National Radio, sparked nationwide conversations about the dangers of cyberbullying. Regulators issued a notice days after her death on the need for regulation over online insults and defamation. The CAC’s latest move adds another layer to Beijing’s expansive efforts to tighten controls on tech platforms run by the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd., Kuaishou Technology, Bilibili Inc. and ByteDance Ltd., which have only just begun to recover from a sweeping two-year crackdown.  Byju’s appointed former State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar and ex-Infosys Ltd. chief financial officer T.V. Mohandas Pai to its advisory council as the Indian education startup tries to contain the fallout from corporate governance lapses. The council at Byju’s, formally called Think & Learn Pvt., will play a key role in advising the company’s board and former teacher-turned CEO Byju Raveendran, the company said in a statement Thursday. Byju’s, once valued at $22 billion, is in turmoil after skipping payments on a $1.2 billion loan and losing its auditor and some of its board members. Adding to its troubles, the Indian government has ordered an inspection into its finances and accounting practices, Bloomberg previously reported. The appointments “underscore Byju’s commitment to enhancing its financial governance mechanisms and leveraging expert advice,” the company said.']\n",

      "['One of India’s biggest venture capital firms is turning more cautious in its investment strategy, alarmed by crises at homegrown startups such as ed-tech leader Byju’s. Blume Ventures, which manages $625 million in assets, is cutting back on “frivolous” investments as it pushes portfolio companies to increasingly shift focus to profitability, co-founder Karthik Reddy said in an interview. About a third of its portfolio, which includes e-commerce and mobility firms, has turned “shaky” over the past year, Reddy said. Perceived corporate governance lapses are sending shockwaves through the South Asian nation’s fledgling startup economy. Byju’s, once India’s most valuable upstart, is in turmoil after missing a deadline on financial statements, skipping payments on a $1.2 billion loan and losing its auditor and some of its board members. The chaos at Byju’s has forced “the entire ecosystem to think about what could be wrong in every portfolio company,” said Reddy, whose firm backs Byju’s rival Unacademy, as well as scores of consumer startups including delivery firm Dunzo and gadget marketplace Cashify. “You get these questions from your investors as well.” A Byju’s representative said the company didn’t have an immediate comment. Byju’s was valued at $22 billion late last year. Last month, one of its main investors, Prosus NV, slashed the value of its stake in a move that pegged Byju’s total valuation at about $5.1 billion. The perceived mis-steps in governance resulted from a venture capital boom that lasted through 2021. Funding has dried up since as slowing economies, rising interest rates and higher levels of inflation prompted venture investors to pull back. Indian startups raised $5.4 billion in the first half of 2023, a decline of more than 70% from the same period last year, according to Tracxn Technologies. Already in 2022, funding dropped to about $27 billion from $43 billion in 2021. “There is very little early-stage investing happening right now,” Reddy said. Blume, based in India’s financial capital of Mumbai, typically provides seed funding to upstarts. That cautiousness dovetails with several small startups shutting down amid the funding winter. Investors have become more prudent and firms such as Blume are wary of writing a cheque for just “another e-commerce, marketplace or influencer marketing idea,” Reddy said.']\n",

The US broker upgraded the sector in China to attractive from in-line and lifted price targets for Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. Japan’s chip sector was also raised to attractive from in-line, with Disco Corp. climbing to overweight.  “We expect tech deflation — price elasticity — coupled with secular AI semi demand will together trigger the next logic semi upcycle,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a July 6 note. “Historically, the reversion of semi inventory days is a strong signal” for stock price appreciation, they added. Global sales data reported by the Semiconductor Industry Association for May showed signs of bottoming out, with revenue rising 1.7% from April, according to a note from Nomura Holdings Inc. Morgan Stanley is expanding its bullish view on the region’s chipmakers after having upgraded some names in South Korea and Taiwan back in October. Since then, chip gauges in both nations have surged more than 27%.  The firm said it had seen a rush of orders over the past two weeks for AI semiconductors, revising up earnings for players such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and recommending that investors participate in a smartphone recovery. Will Semiconductor Co. was upgraded to overweight.    In a separate note, analysts including Shawn Kim said Korea’s memory chipmakers were set to benefit from a growth of nearly 10 times in the DRAM market to $19 billion over the next four years. SK Hynix was their top pick. The firm’s bullish view came before Samsung announced its worst quarterly revenue since at least 2009.   “We are likely to see EPS power expectations meaningfully raised over the coming years behind the emergence of high bandwidth memory and accelerating demand for AI servers,” Kim wrote.

While Tesla uses batteries made by LG Energy Solution Ltd. and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., they need to be built into battery modules and packs before they’re installed in a vehicle.

The $300 million AssetPlus Korea Rich Together fund, managed by Kang Ja-In, is sitting on a 39% gain in 2023. The strategy is to sift for companies adding products or expanding into new markets, while also using a ratio of free cash flow to market value as a key criteria.  That means shunning the chip industry leaders Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. While the price-to-earnings ratios for these two companies are low, their free cash flow is “significantly reduced by their huge capital expenditure every year,” Kang said in an interview. “The companies on the chip supply chains such as materials and equipment makers seem a lot more attractive,” said the money manager at Seongnam-based AssetPlus Investment Management Co. For example, Kang recently increased holdings in TEMC Co., an industrial gas provider that supplies to SK Hynix, to 5% on the bet that he will reap a more than twofold return. Kang’s fund invests in both Korea’s benchmark Kospi index, as well as the Kosdaq Index, which tracks smaller stocks. It also outperformed 97% of its peers in the past five-year period with an annualized return of 9.16%, exceeding the 4.58% comparative return, according to Bloomberg data.  That’s thanks in part to early bets on the Korean entertainment sector, such as SM Entertainment Co., electric-vehicle suppliers like Seoyon E-Hwa Co. and defense suppliers including Hanwha Aerospace Co.  Kang said Hanwha is still attractive, even after a 79% year-to-date rally, given the size of the global defense industry is estimated to be about five times larger than the memory-chip sector.

      "['Sega Corp., the gaming studio once regarded among the staunchest advocates of blockchain gaming, is pulling back from an arena devastated by the global crypto industry meltdown. The company behind Sonic The Hedgehog and Yakuza will withhold its biggest franchises from third-party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content, co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi told Bloomberg News. It’s also shelving plans to develop its own games in that genre at least for now, he added. The remarks, from an executive who helped launch the PlayStation at Sony Group Corp. decades ago, underscore a shift at the 60-year-old firm. Sega, along with rivals like Square Enix Holdings Co. and Bandai Namco Holdings Inc., previously advocated using blockchain-based technology it believes can boost the appeal of its titles. Those were the days platforms such as Axie Infinity, where gamers earn tokens just by playing, were taking off. But the digital currency market collapse wiped out much of their appeal. Sega does plan to let external partners use its lesser-known Three Kingdoms and Virtua Fighter characters for non-fungible tokens, a sort of certificate that confirms ownership of a digital asset. The company’s intent to join the once-red-hot NFT community, first announced in 2021, drew widespread criticism from gamers who viewed crypto technology as bad for the environment.  “The action in play-to-earn games is boring,” Utsumi told Bloomberg News. “What’s the point if games are no fun?” Read more: NFTs in Video Games Become Cautionary Tale for the Metaverse Utsumi was also non-committal about employing Web 3.0 technology in what Sega dubs its “super game” initiative: a lineup of big-budget online multiplayer games due to roll out from 2026.  “We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all,” he added. Sega’s shift reflects a broader cooling on the concept of web3 — a term used to describe an internet built around the blockchain — that once attracted billions of dollars from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz. Peers such as Ubisoft Entertainment SA have pulled back on their investments in NFT games after drawing criticism amid low interest.  Sega will still offer its lesser franchises to several blockchain games to be announced later this year, and will continue to invest in related projects — to the tune of hundreds of millions of yen in each case, Utsumi said. The technology remains useful, for instance by making it possible to move characters and items between different games, he said. Longer-term, Sega remains open to getting more involved as the technology matures. “For the majority of people in the video game industry, what blockchain advocates say may sound a bit extreme, but that’s how the first penguin has always been,” Utsumi said, describing risk-takers who’re the first to take the plunge. “We should never underestimate them.” Read more: NFT Prices Slump as Popular Collection Tumbles Following Debut']\n",

      "['Electric vehicle sales growth, while still brisk, has begun to slow in the US as inventory of battery-powered models piles up on dealer lots. Sales of plug-in models grew by nearly 50% in the first half of the year, according to data from researcher Motor Intelligence. That’s less than the 65% growth rate for all of 2022 and well off the 71% gain in the first half of last year over the same period in 2021. The slower pace comes as the supply of EVs on dealer lots ballooned to 92 days in June, well above the 51 days of inventory for all models, according to researcher Cox Automotive. That may help explain why only 31% of dealers see EVs as the future, while 53% of car buyers do, according to a survey Cox conducted. “Dealers, staring at almost 100 days supply, perhaps are a bit more realistic,” Mark Schirmer, a Cox spokesman, said Thursday in an email. “The extra inventory is making some dealers a bit concerned.” Automakers are pouring $200 billion into constructing nearly 100 EV assembly and battery plants in the United States in the biggest build-up since the industry was founded more than a century ago, according to consultant KPMG. Consumer acceptance in the US has been slower than in China and Europe, as American car buyers have balked at high prices and spotty charging infrastructure. But legacy and startup automakers are betting their futures on catching up with Tesla Inc., which generates profit margins twice the going rate in the industry while controlling 60% of the US EV market. Wall Street is skeptical of EV growth ambitions such as Ford Motor Co.’s plan to boost output of battery powered models by more than 15-fold to 2 million vehicles a year by the end of 2026. Equity researcher CFRA lowered its rating on Ford to “hold” from “buy” Thursday after the automaker reported a 2.8% decline in EV sales in the second quarter. CFRA cited “sluggish” growth for Ford’s F-150 Lightning plug-in pickup, which saw sales rise just 4% from the first quarter to the second. “We think EV production ramp-up issues are likely to be widespread among traditional automakers as they attempt to execute aggressive growth plans,” Garrett Nelson, a senior analyst for CFRA, wrote in a note.

      "['Amazon.com Inc.’s $1.65 billion bid to buy vacuum cleaner maker iRobot Corp. faces an in-depth European Union investigation amid concerns the takeover could thwart competitors by giving the ecommerce giant access to a new stash of user data. The European Commission, the EU’s merger watchdog, set a deadline of Nov. 15 to vet the potential impact of deal, which has sparked a backlash from privacy activists. Aside from thwarting rival robot vacuum cleaners, Amazon’s access to iRobot’s data may make “it more difficult for rival marketplace providers to match Amazon’s online marketplace services,” the commission said. “Thus, the transaction may raise barriers to entry and expansion for Amazon’s competitors to the detriment of consumers.” The decision puts the commission at odds with Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which has given the deal the green light after concluding that iRobot has a relatively modest market power. Amazon said in a statement that it will work with regulators to address questions and concerns raised.  “We believe Amazon can offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers,” it said. So-called phase 2 probes add about 90 working days to deal reviews. Regulators typically demand remedies to solve competition concerns but sometimes also decide to give their unconditional approval if initial concerns are shown to be unfounded.

This week, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram officially introduced Threads, an app designed as a direct rival to Twitter. On Threads, pre-existing Instagram users can access a “text-based conversation app.” It resembles Twitter in its format, dynamics and even name, — “threads” on Twitter are a series of connected tweets from one account. Not surprisingly, Meta has been open about challenging Musk’s most recent acquisition, with Zuckerberg claiming that “hasn’t nailed it.” The new app has added more than 30 million users in its first hours, according to Meta, but it’s a work in progress. Instagram Chief Executive Officer Adam Mosseri posted on Threads that many basic features like hashtags, direct messages and ads may be added later.  Here’s how specific features compare in Threads, Instagram and Twitter. Read More: Why Meta Is Launching a Twitter Rival Called Threads']\n",

      "['After months of painful job cuts, companies in San Francisco’s tech sector stepped up hiring in May, spurred in part by an artificial intelligence boom, according to a new report.  San Francisco and neighboring San Mateo County added 2,800 jobs in the tech sector in May, according to the city’s latest employment update. The new hires mean the region has recovered 38% of jobs since a wave of industry cuts began in late 2022, said San Francisco’s chief economist Ted Egan.  “The stock market, especially Big Tech, is doing very well this year and that tends to be a leading indicator for hiring, especially in San Francisco,” said Egan. He expects the artificial intelligence sector accounted for much of the job growth given the “huge chunk of buzz” the industry is generating. Companies like OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and Anthropic, which recently raised $450 million for a competing AI-powered chatbot, are both based in San Francisco. While the latest data indicates an AI-fueled hiring increase, it does not provide a breakdown of where the new jobs were located between San Francisco and nearby cities to the south in San Mateo County.   The news is a welcome development for San Francisco, said Egan. The city is dealing with one of the country’s worst pandemic-era recoveries. Bay Area tech companies including Salesforce, Alphabet and Meta saw a massive hiring spree during the pandemic before pulling back in 2022 as rising interest rates hit the industry. Since then, many employers have exited office space as retailers flee San Francisco’s blighted downtown core.  But Egan said tech industry growth will not necessarily translate into new office occupancies as remote work becomes a permanent trend for tech workers. San Francisco’s office vacancy rate soared to a record high of nearly 32% in the second quarter, according to data from CBRE Group Inc. “That is a separate problem for downtown,” said Egan.']\n",

      "['Sales of Square Enix Holdings Co.’s new Final Fantasy game tumbled during the second week after its release, a sign of continued weak momentum in the video game publisher’s biggest titles.  Final Fantasy XVI’s mainstay Japan sales fell almost 90% to 37,763 copies during the week to July 2, video game tracker Famitsu estimates showed Thursday. The figure does not include digital downloads. The latest installment in the long-running role-playing franchise debuted two weeks ago exclusively on Sony Group Corp.’s PlayStation 5, with initial hopes high that the $69.99 game would be the blockbuster Square Enix needed. Square Enix shares fell as much as 1.3% before paring losses and gaining 0.1% during early morning trade in Tokyo Friday. The broader Topix Index was down around 0.7%.

Shares in Square Enix have slid 14% since the release of the big-budget game in June. The game’s dropoff in its second week isn’t atypical. Final Fantasy XV in 2016 and Final Fantasy VII Remake in 2020 both incurred a similar 90% sales decline. “Everything in XVI is just so different from the previous Final Fantasy games that fans loved,” Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said. Even when taking into account the number of people who might have purchased the game digitally, the sales figures are low, he said. “It would be difficult to sell more without a deep price cut.” ']\n",

      "[' For once, I’m excited about a Meta copycat product. But first...  Three things you need to know today:    • A cyber breach of London hospitals is under investigation• Mark Zuckerberg is under fire from Chinese state media• A new effort bolstered Japan’s chipmaking ambitions When Meta added  its “stories” feature to Instagram in 2016, my friends and I collectively rolled our eyes. Meta was clearly copying Snapchat, trying to jump on the latest social trend by adding posts that expired a day later. We didn’t need or even want the feature, so we were fine staying on Snapchat.  Fast forward a few years later and Stories has become one of the most popular features on both Facebook and Instagram. I admit that I, and all my friends, now use it more than regular posts. We felt the same way when Instagram copied TikTok by introducing “reels”: Skeptical at first, and then believers. We even have an Instagram group chat dedicated to sharing reels we find entertaining or amusing. Yesterday Meta launched a Twitter rival called Threads, but this time I’m optimistic. Threads is a text-based social network that looks a lot like the app Elon Musk bought last year for $44 billion. You can follow people, share what’s on your mind, and reply to others. There’s a central feed on the home page, a tab for posts that you like and a tab for notifications.  I took an early look at Threads and it has some advantages: You can sign up with your Instagram account and keep your username. It’s really easy to follow all of your Instagram connections, so it won’t take long for the product to feel useful. People who are already verified on Instagram can keep their blue checks, so knowing people are who they say they are won’t be as difficult as it is on Twitter these days. Threads will have the same content-moderation policies and infrastructure as Instagram. Basically, users get all the benefits of Twitter without some of the downsides: like paying for verification, limits on the number of tweets you can view, a rise in hate speech, and so on. Twitter has made a lot of changes since Musk took over, and even though Twitter users didn’t like many of them, they had nowhere to go. There are downsides. Having to connect to Instagram might be annoying if you’re not a user or fan of that app. For now, it won’t be available in the EU. And it does feel weird to root for the already-dominant company in social media. But the current Twitter alternatives like Post, Mastodon and Bluesky simply don’t have enough users to feel like you’re spending your time well by posting there. Meta won’t have this problem: More than 3 billion people use Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp each month. More than 2 billion people use Instagram. In the first four hours, Threads passed 5 million signups. Twitter users have griped for months about Twitter changing into something they didn’t want. But people stayed because their community mostly stayed. Now competition is heating up — and that can only be a good thing. Amazon’s CEO asked his Hollywood studio to explain its big spending. Last year, the company spent $7 billion on original shows, licensed programs and sports. Only Netflix and Disney spend more on streaming. Alibaba agreed to work with its home province in China, one of the nation’s wealthiest, to develop AI and the digital economy there. Twitter settled with a former employee who US labor board prosecutors said was illegally punished for protesting its return-to-office mandate. Meta’s Twitter competitor won’t be offered in the EU for now as the company works out how data sharing between the new service and Instagram will be regulated. Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud will step down from her position at the business video software company at the end of August. Chatbots, data scientists, software engineers. As clients demand more for less, law firms are hiring growing numbers of staff who’ve studied technology, not tort law, to try and stand out from their rivals.

      "['Once one of the highest-rated stocks on Wall Street, Alphabet Inc. is getting a cooler reception from analysts after rallying 36% this year. The Internet search giant has 47 buy ratings, the lowest in at least three years, among the 55 analysts tracked by Bloomberg that cover it. While that still reflects more optimism than many other companies in the Nasdaq 100, it’s well below the unanimous approval Alphabet had a year ago, showing that some analysts believe its rebound from a November low is running out of steam.  “I see some short-term headwinds here after the most recent price movement,” David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, said in an interview. He sees Microsoft Corp. increasingly threatening Google’s dominant market share in search.  Investors growing cautious on Alphabet may also be wary of the potential impact of an economic slowdown on cyclical advertising sales, or that ongoing antitrust investigations will weigh on the stock.  “Generally, tech is going to be sensitive to corporate profits,” Jordan Stuart, client portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, said in an interview, adding that conditions are becoming more difficult in areas including consumer spending and company investment in growth. Recent months have seen a few rare downgrades for the company. In May, Loop Capital reducedBloomberg Terminal Alphabet to hold from buy on concerns that it will struggle to maintain dominance in search, as people increasingly turn to artificial intelligence.  Bernstein followed in late June, moving the company to market perform from outperform. Analyst Mark Shmulik wrote that the stock appeared fairly valued, citing a “narrative that has quickly caught up to fundamentals.” UBS downgraded shares of Alphabet last week to neutral from buy, but boosted its price target. Citing medium-term revenue risk from new search displacing ad inventory with generative artificial intelligence responses, analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote that he saw better opportunities in Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. While some analysts worry that Alphabet is behind the curve in artificial intelligence or that the trend will hinder future growth, the stock has both benefited and faced more volatility as a result of the broad-based tech rally fueled by AI in the first half of the year.   In February, Alphabet erased about $170 billion in market value on growing concerns about Bard, Google’s ChatGPT competitor. The shares regained the lost value in May, when the company started rolling out plans to integrate the technology into its search engine. In June, it was the worst performer of the top seven megacap tech stocks.  In terms of valuation, it lags its megacap rivals. The stock sells for about 19 times estimated earnings, compared to Nvidia Corp. at 49 times and Amazon at about 42.  To be sure, some on Wall Street still see its valuation as compelling and think it could continue its run higher. Piper Sandler analysts this week boosted their price targetBloomberg Terminal, noting that there was room for the shares to grow.  Others remain hesitant to move to the sidelines entirely given Alphabet’s solid positioning and long-term growth potential. Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt, who owns the stock, believes the company will overcome the near-term headwinds to climb higher.  For Aptus’ Wagner, it remains a good longer-term bet. “It’s such a wonderful stock for the long run, if I had a chance to own it as a set-it-and-forget-it name for the next three to five years I would,” he said.  Rivian Automotive Inc. has rallied 55% over the last six sessions as the company said it built more battery-electric vehicles last quarter than Wall Street had anticipated and also shipped its first commercial shipments outside the US. The winning streak might come to an end on Thursday however, as it edges lower along with US stock futures.  ']\n",

      "['Artificial intelligence-driven gains can propel Microsoft Corp. to join Apple Inc. in the elite category of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion. That’s according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, whose new $415 price target for the software giant implies a valuation of around $3.1 trillion. The analysts, led by Keith Weiss, named Microsoft their top pick among large cap software companies, and said that it is the best placed in the sector to benefit from the growth of AI. “Generative AI looks to significantly expand the scope of business processes able to be automated by software,” Weiss wrote in a note. “Microsoft stands best positioned in software to monetize that expansion.” A market frenzy for all things AI-related has supercharged Microsoft shares this year. Startup OpenAI Inc., which is backed by Microsoft, has fueled much of the excitement amid the viral success of its ChatGPT tool. Microsoft is now looking to overhaul its entire lineup of Office apps — including Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Word — with OpenAI technology. Despite a 42% share-price rally this year, the valuation is “still reasonable,” according to Weiss. The stock’s so-called PEG ratio, or the price-earnings multiple divided by the expected percentage growth in earnings, “remains in line with historical averages, despite the unrivaled generative AI positioning,” he wrote. The PEG ratio is a metric often used by growth-focused investors. Weiss raised his price target to $415 from $335. That’s the second highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg after Redburn’s $450 target. Morgan Stanley has rated Microsoft overweight since early 2016, and the stock has gained more than 500% in that period. The rest of Wall Street is also overwhelmingly bullish on the stock — with 52 analysts rating it a buy or equivalent. Still, only three of them have price targets that imply Microsoft getting to the historic $3 trillion market capitalization mark by next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft’s stock rose 0.9% on Thursday. Apple made Wall Street history last month as the first company with a market value of over $3 trillion.']\n",

They asked banks and regulators to help identify US high-tech items being shipped to Russia via the Asian financial hub, the people said.  The officials also told those in attendance to strengthen their due diligence when dealing with transactions related to items on the US export control list, according to the report. The meetings took place days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited China, and as concern grows in Washington and Europe over China’s economic relationship with Russia. Western leaders have accused some Chinese companies of aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, leading to debate over potential punishments or other actions.  The US has sanctioned some Chinese companies accused of supplying components eventually used by Russia during the war — restrictions that China has condemned.  The EU’s response has been more muted as the bloc considers how to balance rate relations with China. After drawing up a proposal to restrict exports to Chinese companies for allegedly supplying Russian firms with banned technology, the EU removed some entities from the list after assurances from Chinese officials.  A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News last month that the bloc was still considering plans to curb trade with three Hong Kong-based firms, though. Representatives from HSBC Holdings Plc, Standard Chartered Plc, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and the Hong Kong Monetary Association all attended the meetings in the city with the US representatives, according to the Nikkei. The Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists, an industry group, was also there.

And they spent a lot less cash: $39.8 billion, down by nearly half from the same period last year. Take out the   more than $6.5 billion investors spent on payments company Stripe, and the total looks even worse, said PitchBook analyst Kyle Stanford. The biggest drop came in angel or seed deals, which is financing for startups usually still at the concept stage. In that category, there were half as many funding deals as there were a year earlier. Those early funding rounds — when young companies are either nurtured or starved — are generally considered to be critical to the health of the venture ecosystem.  But the lower deal numbers aren’t all bad news, Stanford said. In the heady days of the pandemic boom, there were “probably too many” startups raising money because the public markets can only support so many public offerings, he said. “Starting these companies slower is probably healthy.”  Funding for larger startups that are closer to the public markets wasn’t as hard-hit. In that category, investors funded 210 US deals in the quarter, up from 196 a year earlier. However, more did not mean better, Stanford said. Many of those deals were small extension rounds, used to allow the startups to raise more cash while keeping valuations higher than they would have been if the companies raised money in larger, traditional deals.  The numbers signal the continuation of a months-long slump for private tech companies. Last year, as high interest rates threw the industry into turmoil, startups   laid off staff and cut valuations as VC funding fell. Now, even as public tech companies have staged a comeback on the stock market, private markets are still feeling the impact of the slump. Globally, startups raised $87.4 billion, down from $152.9 billion a year earlier. The cash went to 10,571 deals, down from 12,696 a year earlier. PitchBook’s numbers don’t include the $10 billion funding round for OpenAI, a spokeswoman said, because it was a corporate investment that amounted to a near-majority stake.  One problem for private companies is that there are still relatively few major initial public offerings and big acquisitions. The value of exits — deals in which companies get acquired or go public — fell to $51.5 billion globally in the second quarter, PitchBook found. Most of that value was concentrated in Asia. In the US, the total value of exits was just $5.5 billion — largely because of a dour market for IPOs. In better economic times, startups were focused on growth above all, but now investor sentiment has changed. “Investors are looking at that saying, ‘That’s not what I want to invest in,’” Stanford said. “They’re saying, ‘I want to invest in a company that has some semblance of a path to profitability.” VCs themselves are also seeing a tighter fundraising climate. Venture capital firms raised just $33.3 billion in the US this year, on track for the lowest total since 2017. One bright spot was Asia, where venture funds raised money roughly on par with 2022.']\n",

      "['Tesla Inc. and China’s top automakers pledged to maintain fair competition and avoid “abnormal pricing” in the world’s biggest EV market, signaling a possible end to a price war that’s rattled the industry this year.  Executives from 16 companies took part in a signing ceremony at the China Auto Forum in Shanghai on Thursday, acknowledging and committing to four points laid out in the pledge. They included BYD Co., Nio Inc., Xpeng Inc., Geely and Chery Automobile Co., while Tesla was the only foreign brand.  The Austin, Texas-based electric-vehicle maker started cutting prices in China late last year, prompting other major brands to join in with steep discounts in the earlier part of 2023 as sales slowed.  Weak demand in China partly stemmed from the legacy of Covid, and also from expectations that car prices would continue falling. The resulting inventory buildup paved the way for discounts and exacerbated concerns in government, which is in the midst of a campaign to promote EV adoption in rural areas, among other measures to lift the auto industry and wider consumption.  Read more: China Growth Momentum Slows Further Amid Calls for Stimulus The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology directed the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers to bring the 16 companies together to sign the pact, Communist Party official Miao Wei said at Thursday’s event. The companies also vowed to help stabilize growth and avoid risk.  Among EV makers, Elon Musk’s Tesla and BYD, China’s biggest car brand, were at the forefront of the price war in the cut-throat market. As early as March, some models made at Tesla’s Shanghai plant were 14% cheaper than in 2022. The reductions angered customers — Tesla owners complained at stores and distribution centers, with some even ransacking a so-called Experience Center.  There were already signs that the trend was easing prior to Thursday’s signing. Cuts had become less aggressive and in some cases prices were revised upward as sales regained momentum. Deliveries from Tesla’s Shanghai plant in June climbed almost 20% from a year earlier, and shipments from Chinese automakers such as BYD and Li Auto Inc. also jumped. Authorities expect last month’s new-energy vehicle sales to have risen 30% from June 2022.  “The agreement comes at a time when the price war is already at the point of pause,” China Passenger Car Association Secretary General Cui Dongshu said.

      "['Tesla Inc. chief executive Elon Musk reaffirmed his vision of a robot-fueled future, calling for more regulatory oversight of artificial intelligence at a high-profile Chinese government-backed conference Thursday. The billionaire entrepreneur and Twitter-owner, who has warned in the past that AI development was proceeding too swiftly, lauded China’s advances in the field while repeating promises to share Tesla’s self-driving discoveries with rivals. Musk’s brief keynote speech at the conference, a two-day affair centering on China’s AI effort backed by influential regulatory agencies, underscores his deep ties to the world’s No. 2 economy. The Tesla chief wrapped up his first visit to China since the pandemic about a month ago, during which he toured a Shanghai facility that accounted for more than half of Tesla’s global production. Musk reiterated his view that full self-driving should emerge later this year, as the world moves toward a future where robots will outnumber humans. He also expressed confidence that China can become a global player in AI, a field that could be a key determinant of the future economic and geopolitical balance. “I admire the Chinese people’s wisdom and determination. As long as the Chinese people decide to do well in one thing, they will, including in AI,” he told the audience via video link.

      "['Chinese Premier Li Qiang said Tokyo’s impending export controls on cutting-edge chip equipment will damage the global economy, according to a Japanese former senior official. Li told Yohei Kono he had reservations about the restrictions and urged countries not to mix politics with economics during a meeting on Wednesday, the former Japanese foreign minister’s secretary, Kazuo Koga, said in a press briefing. The Chinese premier added that Europe’s economic outlook was grimmer than that of Japan or China, according to Koga, who attended the meeting along with the Japanese ambassador to China and nearly 80 members of a business delegation.  The Eurozone fell into recession in the first quarter, with the bloc’s economy shrinking 0.1% between January and March, according to data released last month. In contrast, Japan’s economy expanded at a faster pace than initially expected, while China’s economy grew albeit at a weaker rate.  Chinese state media coverage of the meeting didn’t directly mention export controls or Europe’s economy, instead focusing on expanding business ties with Japan. “China will, as always, support Japanese companies in expanding investment in and cooperation with China,” Li said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Bilateral relations between China and Japan are tense. Beijing has criticized Japan’s plans to release treated nuclear wastewater into the Pacific Ocean, and sees Tokyo’s increased military ties with the US, South Korea and other partners as an attempt to encircle China. Tokyo also signed a Group of Seven statement in May that backed de-risking — a policy seen by Beijing as aimed at containing China’s development.  For its part, Tokyo is unhappy about the intrusion of Chinese coast guard ships into waters claimed by both sides but controlled by Japan, the recent arrest of a Japanese pharmaceutical executive and China’s increasingly aggressive military actions around Taiwan. These issues were not directly mentioned in readouts of the meeting from either side. Kono referred obliquely to these issues, noting that investment from Japan into China was falling and asking Li to improve the overall environment. Despite the tensions, there are signs China wants to improve ties with Japan. This week’s meeting had been repeatedly postponed at China’s request before being finally allowed to take place, according to a person with knowledge of the planning. China’s top diplomat Wang Yi also met with Kono on Thursday, telling the former Japanese official that Beijing’s relationship with Tokyo was at a “critical juncture,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.  On Monday, Wang attendedBloomberg Terminal an event about ties with Japan and South Korea, during which he called for solidarity among East Asian nations. That bolstered expectations the three countries could this year resume an annual leaders’ summit that was paused during the pandemic. Kono told Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in a separate meeting that many Japanese business executives living in China were concerned about the country’s recently updated anti-espionage law.  Wang askedBloomberg Terminal Japanese companies to help stabilize supply chains, according to a statement from the Commerce Ministry. ']\n",

      "['Malaysia’s markets once marched to the tune of a government that stayed in power for six decades. A rapid turnover of leaders since has driven investors away, turning its assets into some of the most unloved in the world. The benchmark equity gauge is among the worst performers globally this year, and its slide toward a bear market is a stark reversal from when it boasted of the world’s longest bull run. The ringgit suffers a similar fate as the biggest decliner among emerging Asian currencies in 2023. With four administrations since 2018, the nation’s political stability-premium has long since vanished as conflicting agendas hamper growth, and plans to rein in debt fall short. For Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who came to power in November, the challenge is to bring back foreign investments with market-friendly reforms as demand from China, its largest trade partner, slows. “Investors want to see what is the narrative of this new unity government,” said Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Socio Economic Research Centre. “What are the companies that will uplift Malaysia? This will not come from the same traditional sectors, such as commodities.” Global funds have pulled almost a billion dollars from Malaysia’s stock market this year, adding to the net $11 billion that left in the past five years. The exodus started when the long-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition was toppled in 2018 in the face of rising costs of living and corruption allegations.  Since then, four administrations have tussled with the aftermath of removing an unpopular goods and services taxes while finding revenue to plug a fiscal deficit which is among the widest in Southeast Asia. A narrowing trade balance is also hurting the profits of firms already burdened by elevated interest rates, and sapping the currency. “We have to learn how to grow and how to manage the country given the instability, be it instability of politics as well as of the economy,” said Noor Azlan Ghazali, professor of economics at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. “That is a real challenge because in Malaysia whenever we have a change in leadership, then everything has to change as well.” Read More: Malaysia Expected to Hold Rate on Inflation, Ringgit Reprieve Anwar, who is leading a coalition government, is seeking to cut state subsidies and broaden the tax base to reduce debt, while making it easier for foreign companies to do business. In the first quarter, his administration approved foreign direct investments worth 37 billion ringgit ($7.9 billion), up a third from a year ago.  Still, the equity benchmark is down 7.3% this year, just three percentage points away from a bear market. Brokers have slashedBloomberg Terminal their targets. Around 50% of stocks under coverage missed earnings expectations in the first quarter, and just 12% beat them, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. report.  Malaysia has historically “relied on domestic institutional money to sustain premium valuations but this dynamic has eroded over the past few years as domestic institutional funds allocate more money to overseas equities,” said Alan Richardson, portfolio manager at Samsung Asset Management. “Meanwhile, foreign investors struggle to find growth ideas in Malaysia.” The main FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index is largely made up of old-economy stocks, at a time when interest in technology firms and artificial intelligence is drawing traders to other markets. The gauge’s price-to-book valuation of 1.3 times is near the pandemic-low and at a significant discount to the 10-year average.  “Anwar was supposed to be a reformer,” said Raymond Chan, chief investment officer for equity, Asia Pacific, at Allianz Global Investors. He “needs to come up and market the story to foreign investors.” The stock exchange should also attract tech listings, while the government lures more foreign investments, he said.    A weak ringgit, down more than 5% against the dollar this year, partially reflects the “residual risk premium” from the precarious state of government, according to Vishnu Varathan, the Asia head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. The stuttering China economy doesn’t help, he said.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts now see the ringgit weakening to 4.7 against the dollar in six months, from a previous forecast of 4.25. The weak currency “makes the whole investment case for the market less attractive,” for foreign investors, said Dionne Cheung, associate investment director, Asia ex-Japan equities at Schroders.  To be sure, Malaysia does have a toehold in the world of better-valued technology firms. Its burgeoning chip assembly and testing hub, which plays a key role in the semiconductor industry is already drawing investor interest.  Read More: Malaysia Woos Microsoft, Google to Bolster Data Hub Ambitions A JPMorgan analysis shows that 16% of funds under management tracked are in tech stocks, far above their weighting.   In the near term, however, Anwar faces the same challenge as his three predecessors: staying in power. Unfavorable results at upcoming state polls in August may pose a risk for the coalition government head if his allies reassess their support.  “A lot of this policy restructuring is expected to take place in 2H2023,” said Yeah Kim Leng, professor of economics at the Sunway University Business School, who advises the finance ministry. “Investors are on hold, as they anticipate these reforms picking up pace.”']\n",

      "['A rise in cyberattacks poses a vital risk to India’s economic ambitions, with industries from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals becoming more vulnerable as they digitize operations, according to a Google subsidiary. Attacks have spiked significantly in the past six months, said Amit Pradhan, India consulting leader for the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which is owned by Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud. A breach at Suzuki Motorcycle India forced the company to halt production in May, and India’s largest drugmaker said in March a ransomware attack will have an impact on revenue. “Every company in India wants to go digital,” Pradhan said. “The risks are also rising with it.” The breaches underscore how companies in the world’s most populous nation may have neglected cybersecurity as they’ve rapidly built out their digital infrastructure. India is aggressively pushing to become a global force in industries such as electronics manufacturing and an alternative to China, which has lost some of its allure as the world’s factory amid tensions with the US. Ransomware attacks, where a hacker encrypts files and demands a ransom payment, rose 53% in India in 2022, according to a report by CERT-In, the country’s agency for cyberthreats. Ransomware groups have broadened their attacks across critical sectors, according to the report. The increase in high-profile incidents has boosted demand for security software. Companies are now approaching Mandiant not just during emergencies but also to implement preventive measures, Pradhan said. Yet budget constraints mean that Indian companies are still spending less on protection than their counterparts in many other regions. “The country is far behind developed nations when it comes to the importance given to cybersecurity,” Pradhan said. To be sure, some firms are taking steps to reduce vulnerabilities. L&T Technology Services Ltd. is planning to increase spending on cybersecurity by as much as 50% next year, according to Chief Operating Officer Abhishek Sinha. He said the company is moving to a “zero-trust architecture” where it restricts employees’ and vendors’ access to only the data they need. The growing popularity of artificial intelligence is proving to be both a boon and a bane, cybersecurity experts said. Security software companies such as Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. are using AI to detect loopholes in IT systems. But on the other hand, hackers are using ChatGPT and other tools to write malware code and convincing phishing emails, said Smit Kotadiya, a CrowdStrike consultant. “There used to be grammatical errors that we could spot in phishing emails,” Kotadiya said. “Hackers are now smarter than ever before.”']\n",

      "['The Port of Nagoya began gradually resuming operations Thursday afternoon, the Nagoya Harbor Transportation Association said, after an alleged Russian ransomware attack disrupted cargo packing procedures earlier this week. Operations at one cargo terminal resumed Thursday at 3 p.m., the association said in a statement. It aims to restart another terminal by 5:30 p.m., and three others by 6:30 pm. Systems at Japan’s biggest maritime port were restored earlier, but operations took longer to recover, according to the association. The facility was scheduled to resume activity earlier in the day but the recovery of large amounts of deleted data had delayed the process. The ransomware attack, in which hackers block access to files or systems and demand a payment in return for access, caused the container terminal at the port in Aichi Prefecture to halt operations Tuesday morning, the Nagoya Harbor Transportation Authority said Wednesday. “As cybersecurity risks become more complex, the country’s security systems and countermeasures to such threats are increasingly important,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said Thursday, when asked about the attack. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker by units sold, said the attack in Nagoya on Tuesday won’t affect the shipment of new cars yet, but imported and exported parts cannot be loaded or unloaded at the port until the problem is resolved. There wasn’t any impact on production as of Thursday morning, according to a spokesperson for the carmaker. Nagoya is one of several ports globally to be recently targeted by malware. Last Christmas, hackers broke into the computer systems at Portugal’s Port of Lisbon, holding up operations for days. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, India’s busiest container port, also suffered a ransomware attack last year. In 2021, South Africa’s port and rail company was targeted with a strain of ransomware that cybersecurity experts have linked to groups in Eastern Europe and Russia.

      "['Mastercard Inc. is selling a new artificial intelligence-powered tool that helps banks more effectively spot if their customers are trying to send money to fraudsters.  Nine of the UK’s biggest banks, including Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Natwest Group Plc and Bank of Scotland Plc, have signed up to use the Consumer Fraud Risk system, Mastercard told Bloomberg News.  Trained on years of transaction data, the tool helps to predict whether someone is trying to transfer funds to an account affiliated with “authorized push payment scams.” This type of fraud involves tricking a victim into moving money into an account falsely posing as a legitimate payee, such as a family member, friend or a business.  The tool comes as UK banks prepare for new rules from the Payment Systems Regulator that will require them to compensate customers affected by APP scams from 2024. Historically banks haven’t been liable for this type of fraud, although some signed a voluntary agreement to pay back victims.  Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence at Mastercard, described APP scams as a “huge problem” that banks have historically struggled to detect because victims’ accounts aren’t compromised. Clients voluntarily make the transfer and so pass many of the security checks used to identify other types of fraud, such as unauthorized payments, he said.  In the UK, victims of APP scams lost £484.2 million ($616 million) in 2022, according to research by banking industry association UK Finance. Losses to APP fraud across the UK, US and UK are expected to hit $5.25 billion by 2026, according to a report by ACI Worldwide and GlobalData. TSB Banking Group Plc, the first bank to implement the system four months ago, has seen a 20% increase in detection of this type of fraud, which the bank’s Head of Fraud Paul Davis said was one of the biggest improvements of any individual fraud prevention project he’s worked on. TSB estimates it could save UK’s banks about £100 million per year if the tool was rolled out across the industry. “It’s a good example of the power of sharing data,” Davis said in an interview. “It’s the first time we’ve been able to see both sides of the payment — sending and receiving.” Consumer Fraud Risk works by assigning a risk score from 0 to 999 on any attempted bank transfer within half a second — similar to a system it already uses to identify fraudulent credit card payments. The bank can combine this risk score with its own analytics to create an assessment of the transaction and, if necessary, block it before the money leaves the victim’s account. TSB’s Davis said the system has been particularly good at detecting purchase scams, where fraudsters posing as merchants trick people into paying for goods or services that are never received, which represent about half of all APP fraud. It’s also helped reduce false positives – genuine transactions flagged as potential fraud. Mastercard is able to provide the risk score because it runs the infrastructure for real-time electronic transfers of funds through its subsidiary VocalinkBloomberg Terminal. For the past five years, Mastercard has worked with UK banks to follow how scammers move their proceeds through a sequence of “mule” accounts – often at several different banks – to obscure their activity. This has allowed Mastercard to identify patterns of behavior and accounts associated with scams that it’s used to train the Consumer Fraud Risk system. The company, which charges banks a fee for the product based on transaction volume, plans to roll out the tool globally. It’s in discussions with potential clients in markets with mature, real-time payments systems and significant APP fraud, including the US, India and Australia.']\n",

      "['More than 30 million users signed up for Meta Platforms Inc.’s new app Threads, designed as a direct rival to Twitter and the most serious threat yet to Elon Musk’s struggling social-media site. On Threads, people can post text and links and reply to or repost messages from others. The app will let users port over their existing follower lists and account names from Instagram, Meta’s photo and video-sharing app that counts major brands, celebrities and creators among its more than 2 billion users.  “There should be a public conversations app with 1 billion-plus people on it,” Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his Threads account. “Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn’t nailed it. Hopefully we will.” Despite the surge in sign-ups, Threads held steady, with only sporadic reports of temporary glitches. US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has millions of followers on Twitter, posted late Wednesday: “I think my app is bricked. It was just as I hit send on a long post of Queens food recommendations.” Other users talked about the new app’s terms and conditions, which state a Threads account can only be completely deleted if a user also wipes their Instagram account. Zuckerberg’s own posts on the app weren’t loading for some people. The company still has work to do. In replies to Threads users, Instagram head Adam Mosseri acknowledged the lack of certain basic features expected on modern social media apps such as tagging, searching by hashtags and a home feed for people you follow — enhancements which he said are on their list of to-dos. But the strong early interest is a clear sign of demand, Zuckerberg wrote on Threads. Many of Instagram’s influential users have been asking the company to make a text-based app, according to Connor Hayes, a vice president of product. Why Meta Is Launching a Twitter Rival Called Threads: QuickTake “Creators were telling us, ‘We want an alternative to what’s out there, and we don’t want to start over and have to build out a following from zero,’” Hayes said in an interview, without mentioning Twitter specifically. Instagram and Facebook, both owned by Meta, have a long — and successful — history of copying products from upstart internet competitors. The company’s Reels feature was a knockoff of TikTok’s viral video app, and its Stories disappearing posts followed the rise of Snapchat. Meta’s apps in the past have competed indirectly for user attention with Twitter by courting news publishers, politicians and other high-profile people to favor posting on one versus the other. The arrival of Threads marks the first time Meta is releasing a Twitter lookalike. Late Wednesday, Zuckerberg tweeted for the first time in 11 years — taking a playful swipe at his billionaire rival, who in turn called Instagram fake. A lawyer for Musk sent a letter to Zuckerberg accusing Meta of misusing trade secrets and other intellectual property in the creation of Threads after hiring former Twitter employees, Semafor reported on Thursday. A Meta spokesman confirmed the letter from Musk’s attorney, and posted on Threads that no one on the new app’s engineering team is a former Twitter employee.  Still, the timing for the launch seems propitious. Since Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October, the company has cut thousands of employees, loosened its content moderation policies and put users and advertisers through a spate of technical challenges.  Twitter, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is hurting financially, too. Advertising revenue at the San Francisco-based company has declined by 50%, Musk said in March, and he recently hired Linda Yaccarino, a NBCUniversal executive, as chief executive officer to try to improve relationships with brands. “We’re often imitated — but the Twitter community can never be duplicated,” Yaccarino said in a tweet without naming Meta’s new app. “YOU built the Twitter community. And that’s irreplaceable. This is your public square.” As of the Wednesday launch of Threads, Twitter is still limiting how many tweets per day users can view — a measure Musk called “temporary” in order to fend off data scrapers and bots.  Those restrictions are only the latest move prompting Twitter users to seek alternatives. But most of the company’s previous direct challengers, such as Bluesky and Mastodon, haven’t built up networks big enough to give posts the reach and impact they have on Twitter. Many new alternative networks are also still building out systems for managing harmful, inappropriate or violent content. Read more: Meta’s Threads App Won’t Launch in EU on Regulatory Concerns Threads will embark with all those mature company systems in place, thanks to Instagram’s existing infrastructure. The app will have the same content rules as Instagram, with the same controls for muting and blocking harassing accounts. Public figures who have verified accounts on Instagram can maintain their blue badges on Threads. Earlier this year, Twitter turned verification into a paid-only feature. “People are looking for an experience where they have more control, and where safety is built into the product from the start,” Hayes said. Another selling point, Hayes said, is that Threads is built on the same ActivityPub social-networking protocol as Mastodon and other decentralized social-media apps. That means people who build followings on Threads eventually will be able to use the app to interact with a wider community beyond Instagram. It’s the first Meta app that will be interoperable with competing products, though Hayes didn’t give a timeline for that update. Threads is also launching without ads — for now, the focus is to get as many people excited about the product as possible, Hayes said. Shares of Meta were little changed in New York at 3:12 p.m. on Thursday, amid broader stock market declines after the latest US jobs data. Snap Inc. was down about 2%. ']\n",

The Ariane 5, operated by the European commercial launch provider Arianespace SA, successfully left French Guiana with a pair of satellites for the German Space Agency and the French Directorate of Armaments.  Arianespace plans on flying its successor, the Ariane 6, before the end of the year. It is being built by ArianeGroup, a joint venture of Airbus SE and Safran SA. The European Space Agency, which oversees the Ariane program, agreed in 2014 to develop the updated model with a targeted 2020 launch date. The rocket’s debut has been repeatedly delayed. While Arianespace is targeting a 2023 launch, one of the Ariane 6’s major parts suppliers predicted in May that it wouldn’t fly until early 2024.

      "['The US is considering restrictions on China’s access to computing over the Internet, or the cloud, as part of attempt to limit that country’s ability to develop artificial intelligence capabilities, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The effort is a top priority for the Commerce Department and adds to the Biden administration’s attempts to tighten export controls on semiconductors imposed last October. Officials are working to finalize the plan this summer, although important details have yet to be decided, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that aren’t yet public. The US is concerned that access to cloud services may provide China’s companies and its military with the computing power needed for AI models, bypassing the need to invest in data centers made up of computers and their semiconductor components, many of which are already covered by existing rules, the person said. But the use of cloud computing is harder to track than the export of semiconductors, complicating efforts to regulate it.  The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported the Commerce Department’s plans to tighten export controls, including on cloud services provided by Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The agency and both companies declined to comment on that report.  The Biden administration is seeking to contain China’s development of a technology considered key to the country’s geopolitical and economic future.  Why AI Is Next Flashpoint in US-China Tech Rivalry: QuickTake As part of the plan, Commerce would expand two parameters that set the threshold for the export controls imposed last year, said the person. The proposal aims to further restrict both the performance capability of chips and the ability to string chips together, the person said. Under the broader Commerce Department proposal, the US would revise export controls to make it harder to sell some chips to China without a license. The move is aimed in part at Nvidia Corp.’s A800 chip, which the US-based company designed after the earlier controls were announced. The product’s configuration comes just within those limits. The US and China are escalating their technological conflict. On Monday, Beijing slapped controls on the export of metals critical to the chip, electric-vehicle and defense industries, showing it has some power to retaliate against moves by the US, Japan and Europe to cut Beijing off from advanced technology.']\n",

      "['Rivian Automotive Inc. is ready to take on more commercial partners beyond Amazon.com Inc. after a recent bout of production success. “What we saw in Q2 is really the beginnings of the supply chain now running in a healthy way,” Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Rivian sells a consumer pickup truck and sport utility vehicle and manufactures a delivery van for Amazon, its largest shareholder and biggest customer. The deal with Amazon is exclusive, but Scaringe said the carmaker is “in the final stages of negotiating, allowing us to sell the vehicle outside of the Amazon relationship to others.” Shares of Rivian fell 2.2% in premarket trading Thursday to $19.99 as of 9:05 a.m. in New York. The stock was up about 11% this year at the close on Wednesday.  The electric-vehicle company reported quarterly production and deliveries earlier this week that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, helping to send shares up more than 45% over six trading days. It also reiterated plans to build 50,000 electric cars this year, lower than some internal projections. “We want to make sure that we over-deliver on our numbers, over-deliver on our targets,” Scaringe said at Rivian’s headquarters in Irvine, California. Rivian has struggled with manufacturing delays since going public in November 2021. Even with its recent stock boost, shares are still far below the price of its IPO, which was the largest since Meta Inc., then known as Facebook, went public early last decade. A torrid 2022 saw Rivian stock drop 82%. The company has been able to ease a supply-chain bottleneck in part by developing a new motor in-house known as Enduro. The technology supplements a four-motor design made by Robert Bosch GMBH that has faced lingering backlogs. That has helped it boost output of its R1S electric SUV, which accounts for about 70% of its pre-orders. “When we sourced the power semis for the inverter in Enduro, we sourced in a really thoughtful way,” Scaringe said. “That gave us enough capacity and confidence around our supply chain.” Read more: Rivian Surges After Quarterly Production Beats Expectations The company doesn’t provide production volumes by vehicle type. This quarter, production of the SUV is expected to surpass the pickup. And earlier this week, the company said it had started shipping Amazon’s vehicles to Europe. All output is from a sole facility in Normal, Illinois. During the interview, Scaringe said the company was guiding that around 20% of its overall production volumes would be vans for Amazon. Rivian’s deal with Amazon commits it to delivering 100,000 electric delivery vans for the e-commerce giant by the end of the decade. Amazon has taken delivery of and rolled out more than 5,000 Rivian EDV vans so far in more than 800 cities in the US, the e-commerce giant said in a statement on Thursday. It had previously disclosed 3,000 of the vans built by Rivian being operational. While Rivian’s life as a public company has been short, it has been a long journey for Scaringe, who holds a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 40-year-old founded the company in 2009, but went a decade before taking Rivian out of stealth mode when the designs for a pickup and SUV were unveiled. That put it on a pace to be the first company to bring electric-battery powered vehicles for those classes to market.  Read More: Ex-JPMorgan Banker Maps Rivian’s Path to Regain Wall Street Halo Scaringe has brought in new leaders. Claire McDonough, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. investment banker, joined as chief financial officer in early 2021. One of her first contributions was to help Rivian to the sixth-biggest listing in US history. Frank Klein joined Rivian from Magna International Inc. to shore up manufacturing and operations as chief operations officer.']\n",

Sud will be replaced by board member Adam Gross, who will become interim CEO on Sept. 1 while the company searches for a permanent replacement, according to a statement from the company on Wednesday. Gross has served as a member of Vimeo’s board since May 2021. From 2013 to 2018, Gross held several executive marketing and product leadership positions at Salesforce Inc. “Having spent the last two years working closely with the executive team and the details of the business, I’m thrilled to step into this role to accelerate and streamline the company’s strategy in making video a key part of how every business communicates with its customers, employees, and partners,” Gross said. Sud, who was appointed to the position in 2017 after previously serving as general manager and head of marketing, is leaving to pursue a new opportunity, according to the statement. Sud said Vimeo had “a challenging road on the growth side.” The path forward, according to Sud, lies in continuing the company’s pivot from serving consumers to serving businesses in order to make video a strategic tool for companies. “The need for video is global,” Sud said in an interview, “and we want to be the platform of choice for the largest companies.” Vimeo was spun off from Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActive Corp. in May 2021. Users of its cloud-based video software range from small customers like schools and coffee shops to large enterprises such as Amazon.com Inc. and Intuit Inc.

Zhejiang, a province on China’s eastern seaboard, entered a cooperation agreement with Alibaba, vowing to create a better business environment for platform-economy firms and to encourage innovations in areas including artificial intelligence, according to a report of Securities Times on Wednesday. While the backing for Alibaba came from a provincial, not national, government, a separate statement Wednesday showed that a national regulator backed Zhejiang in taking the lead in trials for platform-economy innovation. That deal was signed between the State Administration for Market Regulation and Zhejiang. The developments suggest official backing for Alibaba’s efforts, against a backdrop in recent years of regulatory moves against the firm. Chinese policymakers have also been steadily calling for innovative advances in digital applications, as part of a broader effort to support economic growth. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, who signed the pact with local government officials, said that the digital economy has entered a new age with artificial intelligence sweeping the world this year, according to the report. Alibaba is dedicated to building Zhejiang into a world-class digital economy cluster, leveraging its technology platform, Zhang also said.

      "['    Matthew Strohmeyer is sounding a little giddy. The US Air Force colonel has been running data-based exercises inside the US Defense Department for years. But for the first time, he tried a large-language model to perform a military task. “It was highly successful. It was very fast,” he tells me a couple of hours after giving the first prompts to the model. “We are learning that this is possible for us to do.”Large-language models, LLMs for short, are trained on huge swaths of internet data to help artificial intelligence predict and generate human-like responses to user prompts. They are what power generative AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard.Five of these are being put through the paces as part of a broader series of Defense Department experiments that are focused on developing data integration and digital platforms across the military. The exercises are run by the Pentagon’s digital and AI office and military top brass, with participation from US allies. The Pentagon won’t say which LLMs are in testing, though Scale AI, a San Francisco-based startup, says its new Donovan product is among the LLM platforms being tested. The use of LLMs would represent a major shift for the military, where so little is digitized or connected. Currently, making a request for information to a specific part of the military can take several staffers hours or even days to complete, as they jump on phones or rush to make slide decks, Strohmeyer says.In one test, one of the AI tools completed a request in 10 minutes.“That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s ready for primetime right now. But we just did it live. We did it with secret-level data,” he says of the experiment, adding it could be deployed by the military in the very near term. Strohmeyer says they have fed the models with classified operational information to inform sensitive questions. The long-term aim of such exercises is to update the US warhorse so it can use AI-enabled data in decision-making, sensors and ultimately firepower.Dozens of companies, including Palantir Technologies Inc., co-founded by Peter Thiel, and Anduril Industries Inc. are developing AI-based decision platforms for the Pentagon.Microsoft Corp. recently announced users of the Azure Government cloud computer service could access AI models from OpenAI. The Defense Department is among Azure Government’s customers.The military exercise, which runs until July 26, will also serve as a test of whether military officials can use LLMs to generate entirely new options they’ve never considered. For now, the US military team will experiment by asking LLMs for help planning the military’s response to an escalating global crisis that starts small and then shifts into the Indo-Pacific region. The exercises are playing out as warnings are mounting that generative AI can compound bias and relay incorrect information with striking confidence. AI can also be hacked in multiple ways, including by poisoning the data that feeds it. Such concerns are among reasons the Pentagon is running the experiment, Strohmeyer says, adding that they have made a point to “get a strong understanding” of sources of information. The Defense Department is already working with tech security companies to help test and evaluate how much they can trust AI-enabled systems.In a demonstration based on feeding the model with 60,000 pages of open-source data, including US and Chinese military documents, Bloomberg News asked Scale AI’s Donovan whether the US could deter a Taiwan conflict, and who would win if war broke out. A series of bullet points with explanations came back within seconds. “Direct US intervention with ground, air and naval forces would probably be necessary,\" the system stated in one answer, warning in another that the US would struggle to quickly paralyze China’s military. The system’s final note: “There is little consensus in military circles regarding the outcome of a potential military conflict between the US and China over Taiwan.” A hacking group that has targeted states over transition bans claims it hit satellite systems.

      "['British cybersecurity officials are investigating an alleged cyberattack on a group of hospitals in London that has led to the disclosure of confidential documents online. A gang of Russian-speaking cybercriminals known as ALPHV, or BlackCat, claimed on its website last week that it had obtained seven terabytes of internal documents from the Barts Health NHS Trust, and threatened to post them online unless a ransom is paid. A spokesperson for the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre said in a statement on Wednesday that it was “working with Barts Health NHS Trust and partners to fully understand the impact of an incident.”The Information Commissioner’s Office, the regulatory body that oversees data privacy in the UK, confirmed it had received a report of a data breach from Barts and added that it was assessing the matter. A spokesperson for Barts referred to an earlier statement in which it said that it was “urgently investigating” the hacking gang’s claims. The Barts trust manages five hospitals in London that care for about 2.5 million people, making it one of the largest in the country, according to its website. The National Health Service in England and Wales has more than 200 trusts, which manage and provide medical services and function as not-for-profit, public benefit corporations. The breach marks the third major cyberattack that Barts has faced in the last six years. In January 2017, the trust’s systems were infected with malware, which disrupted hospital pathology departments, according to an internal report on that incident. Months later, in May 2017, Barts was hit by the so-called WannaCry ransomware outbreak and had to divert emergency ambulance services to other hospitals, according to a government review of the attack. The damage caused by the latest incident isn’t yet clear. ALPHV is known to deploy ransomware, a kind of malicious software that encrypts a victim’s computers and renders them inoperable. It then demands payment to unlock the computers and threatens to publish stolen data. Increasingly, however, hacking gangs are forgoing ransomware and just stealing data, then threatening to publish it online unless they are paid. The gang published a selection of files it said it stole from the Barts Health, including copies of employees’ driving licenses and passports, in addition to internal emails and correspondence marked confidential. In broken English, the hackers claimed on their dark web page that the haul of data from Barts Health amounted to the “most bigger leak from health care system in UK.”ALPHV hackers communicate in Russian, and they have been active since November 2021, carrying out attacks on a wide range of companies across dozens of sectors, including construction and engineering, retail, transportation, commercial services, insurance, telecommunication and pharmaceuticals, according to  a report published last year by researchers at Unit 42, a cybersecurity team at Palo Alto Networks Inc.

      "['Twitter has settled with a former employee who US labor board prosecutors concluded was illegally punished for protesting its return-to-office mandate. Security software engineer Alex Camacho claimed the company put them on administrative leave in retaliation for posting a message urging coworkers to take collective action against the company’s return-to-office policy.  A regional director of National Labor Relations Board found merit in Camacho’s allegation, and the NLRB informed Twitter that it would issue a complaint unless the company settled the case, according to agency spokesperson Kayla Blado. Twitter and Camacho then reached a settlement, the terms of which weren’t disclosed. Twitter’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry about the case, and the company didn’t specifically respond to a request for comment.  Elon Musk, who took control of Twitter last October, told employees in November that they would immediately be expected to spend at least 40 hours per week in the office, ending Twitter’s permanent work-from-anywhere option. He also quickly dismissed around half of the company’s workforce and most of its executive suite. Camacho’s attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said in a text message that she was “very pleased” to have reached “a fair resolution” in the case. “We look forward to vindicating the rights of our remaining clients through litigation, arbitration, and wherever else we can,” said Liss-Riordan, who represents more than 1,900 former Twitter employees who’ve brought claims against the company since Musk’s takeover. “The formerly richest man in the world is not above the law.” Federal law protects the right of workers to discuss and take collective action about working conditions, with or without a union. The NLRB, which enforces that law, has the power to order changes to policies and back pay for employees, but not to hold executives personally liable or make companies pay punitive damages. Musk’s companies have repeatedly clashed with the NLRB. The US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in March upheld an NLRB ruling that Tesla Inc. illegally fired an employee at the electric-car maker’s California auto factory because of his union activism, and that a tweet from Musk constituted an unlawful threat. An agency judge ruled in April that Tesla violated the law by telling workers in Florida not to discuss their pay. In New York, a regional NLRB office is investigating a union’s claim that Tesla was illegally retaliating when it terminated dozens of employees the day after the announcement of an organizing campaign at the company’s Buffalo plant. Tesla has denied wrongdoing in each case.']\n",

      "[\" The US is escalating a chip war against China. But first...  Three things you need to know today:    • China restricted exports of chipmaking metals• Multiple lawsuits accused Twitter of ducking layoff fights• Rivian surged after quarterly production beat expectations Washington has over the past year landed several decisive blows against Beijing in its fight to suppress China’s technology ambitions. After banning Nvidia Corp.’s most powerful artificial intelligence chips from Chinese firms and striking agreements with Japan and the Netherlands to also withhold advanced gear, I thought Washington was done. I was wrong.  It’s becoming clear the Biden administration is turning the heat up several more notches, regardless of any retaliatory measures China may threaten or adopt.  Again and again, I think back to US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s comments last September that the US intends to keep “as large of a lead as possible” when it comes to certain technologies, including semiconductors. Consider: US officials could ban even more of Nvidia’s AI chips for China after barring its top-of-the-line A100. Washington is reportedly looking to restrict US firms from leasing cloud services with AI capabilities to Chinese companies. And it’s looking to expand a blockade on the sale of machines made by ASML Holding NV, which are indispensable to advanced semiconductor manufacture. It’s true Washington seems keen to improve relations with Beijing, dispatching a flurry of officials including State Secretary Anthony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to the capital. Officials have been careful to emphasize “de-risking” rather than “decoupling” from the country. Yet it seems the administration is moving on a parallel track when it comes to the guidelines Sullivan articulated with such simplicity about 10 months ago. In doing so, it’s putting some of its biggest corporations in difficult positions: Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia. In particular, what’s surprising about the US move to limit ASML is that it seems to be playing hardball with the Netherlands, a key ally that’s made concessions by joining a US-led global chip blockade against China. Biden officials seem to have taken a leaf out of the playbook of their Trump-era predecessors, trying once again to achieve broad aims through unilateral measures. They’re trying to invoke a rule that stops foreign equipment suppliers providing to China any gear that contains even a modicum of American components, Reuters reported last week.  That sort of extra-territorial reach has proven effective in the past, perhaps most demonstrably when the Trump administration kneecapped Huawei Technologies Co. by similarly banning chipmakers using any US tech from supplying parts to the Chinese telecom gear maker without a license (through the rather esoteric Foreign-Direct Product Rules). But is the Biden administration at risk of undermining its own efforts to distance itself from the unilateralism of the Trump years? The White House has no doubt tried to pressure and cajole allies into its worldview, but it attempted diplomacy before heavy-handed decree. Its latest actions on the chip front risks alienating countries it depends on in its over-arching ambition to contain China's economic ascent. For some, it’s hard to see how the chip wars can get any fiercer — but it could. The curbs haven’t targeted China’s capability to make mature or lower-end chips, and South Korea is so far somewhat non-committal toward joining Washington’s undertaking. My gut tells me we’ve yet to see the final salvo in this battle. Video footage of the riots in France were hugely popular on social media as unrest spread throughout the country, leading French President Emmanuel Macron to blame TikTok, Snapchat and other apps for fueling violence. Adobe’s $20 billion takeover of design software company Figma faces a merger review by European Union officials as global regulators scrutinize record-breaking deals in the digital economy. As China clamps down on exports of two obscure yet crucial metals in an escalation of the trade war on technology with the US and Europe, you might ask: What exactly are gallium and germanium? Apple is slashing production targets for its Vision Pro headset because manufacturers are struggling with the novel gadget’s complex design, the Financial Times reported.

A representative for the commission declined to comment on private business decisions. A number of companies, including Meta, have self-designated themselves as “gatekeepers” under the DMA rules, which will potentially make them subject to stricter regulations around data sharing and giving preference to their own products.  Gatekeepers are banned from combining users’ personal data across different platforms under the DMA.  Threads is designed to let users follow the same accounts they’ve connected with on Instagram and keep their Instagram usernames, helping the social media giant leverage its billions of users to quickly gain scale. The app will compete with Twitter, and will similarly be formatted around text-based posts that can be shared, liked and commented on.  Ireland’s Independent newspaper reported on Tuesday that Threads wouldn’t be offered in the EU at launch, citing a spokesperson for Ireland’s Data Protection Commission. “Meta have informed us that they have no plans to role out the service in the EU at present,” the Irish watchdog’s deputy commissioner Graham Doyle said by phone when contacted by Bloomberg.

Across Amazon, Jassy has also jettisoned 37 different projects deemed unnecessary. The Hollywood studio, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on original programming over the last decade, is an obvious place to look for savings. Last year, Amazon spent $7 billion on original shows, licensed programs and sports, up from $5 billion the year before. Only Netflix and Disney spend more on streaming. In the past nine months, Amazon has released at least a half-dozen pricey series that failed to deliver huge audiences. Daisy Jones & the Six, The Power, Dead Ringers and The Peripheral all cost more than $100 million to produce but failed to crack Nielsen’s list of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US. Even The Rings of Power ($400 million-plus), a show that attracted a large audience, failed to hold on to most of its viewers over the course of the season, according to The Hollywood Reporter. No show illustrates Amazon’s liberal spending better than Citadel, a global spy thriller that cost more than $250 million for one season. Despite being one of the most expensive series in TV history, Citadel has failed to chart as one of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US in any week since it debuted, according to Nielsen. It did hit the top 10 among streaming originals for a week, coming in just behind Netflix Inc.’s Barbecue Showdown.   Amazon has trumpeted the show’s success, and has voiced support by commissioning a second season and continuing work on local spinoffs. It has also boasted of the popularity abroad, especially in India, though it provided no data to prove as much. Yet streaming services want shows made in English to connect with viewers in their biggest market. Odetta Watkins, the company’s head of drama series, said Citadel “needs time” to grow its audience at home. Amazon has long escaped the scrutiny that other entertainment companies attract because it doesn’t report detailed financial results for its studio or the Prime video-streaming service. What’s $7 billion in annual costs for TV programming at a company that generates more than $500 billion in sales? But Jassy is now trying to get a better handle on why specific shows cost what they do, based on conversations with more than a dozen different people who either work at Amazon or have worked with the company on projects. They all asked not to be identified because show budgets and discussions with top executives are confidential. Amazon declined to comment on the record. The studio is led by Jen Salke, who joined Amazon in 2018, bringing experience and talent relationships the company had never had before. A longtime TV executive, Salke had been president of NBC Entertainment, where she worked on shows such as This Is Us and Chicago Fire. She joined Amazon as founder Jeff Bezos was pushing the studio to overhaul its strategy. Salke’s predecessor, Roy Price, had commissioned the critically praised series Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle and won awards with the film festival darlings Manchester by the Sea and The Big Sick. Yet Bezos desired a culture-defining hit like Game of Thrones. We covered this shift in a Bloomberg podcast released last year. Meanwhile, Amazon’s biggest competitor in streaming, Netflix, was churning out new hits every month and had started to pilfer traditional Hollywood studios for top talent like producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. While Price had a couple of mass hits in the pipeline with Jack Ryan and The Boys, he was pushed out before they debuted, following allegations of sexual harassment. With Bezos’ blessing, Salke went on a spending spree that she hoped would shift the studio in a more commercial direction. She spent almost $50 million on three films in one year at the Sundance Film Festival and signed overall deals with Get Out director Jordan Peele, Atlanta creator Donald Glover and Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, among others. They all agreed to bring Amazon their best TV ideas in exchange for funding. Many of these deals yielded no projects or duds, as chronicled in a THR story by Kim Masters. The article also noted that a minority of the viewers who started The Rings of Power, Amazon’s most expensive project ever, finished the series. Her report prompted Amazon to limit what viewership data its own employees can see. Salke’s supporters dismiss criticism of her reign as a mix of sexism and elitism. Most of her biggest hits, including The Terminal List and Jack Ryan, just don’t appeal to coastal elites like HBO’s Succession. While the company has commissioned many shows that look like prestigious HBO fare, the average Amazon customer craves crime shows and sitcoms, like those seen on CBS. Under Salke, the company has shifted toward the latter. Based on viewership data from Nielsen and demand metrics from Parrot Analytics, Amazon produces the   second highest number of original hits. But the gap between Netflix at No. 1 and everyone else looks like this: Even Salke’s biggest supporters acknowledge Citadel hasn’t panned out as intended. The show started not with a creative idea but as a business premise. Salke wanted a global series that could take place in multiple locations and lead to country-specific spinoffs. She approached Joe Russo and his brother Anthony, with whom she had worked on the TV series Community, about producing the show. The Russos have directed some of the highest-grossing movies of all time, including several Marvel films, and parlayed that success into deals with Netflix, Apple and NBCUniversal. If you wanted to produce a big-budget action franchise,  their company AGBO was one of your first calls. One of AGBO’s creative partners, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol screenwriter Josh Appelbaum, was developing a spy show with veteran TV writer Bryan Oh that fit Salke’s mandate. The show was about two dueling spy rings, one good and one evil. The first season of Citadel was supposed to cost around $20 million per episode. But it didn’t take long for the budget to balloon, thanks in part to the pandemic. The Russos disagreed with Appelbaum and Oh about the vision for the project. They wanted to eliminate the love story between characters played by Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and didn’t like other plot elements. The Russos began to play around with a different version of the show in post-production, which is when completed scenes get edited into an actual program. While the main post-production office was in London, the Russos set up a second editing group in Los Angeles and cut an alternate version of the series. They submitted it to Amazon without showing it to the full team. The folks in London then rushed to get their cut of the show to Amazon. Amazon faced a choice between the lesser-known creators of the show and the Russos — and chose the Russos. They also tested both versions with focus groups, and the Russos’ version tested better. But the Russos’ vision required substantial reshoots. They brought in a new writer, David Weil, to overhaul the script and ended up reshooting more than half of the show. This added at least $80 million to the budget. For the second season of Citadel, Joe Russo will direct every episode. He will receive about $25 million for his work. In the end, Amazon supported the Russos’ vision, which is why many in Hollywood have Salke’s back. Cost overruns have been a feature of the streaming boom and aren’t limited to Amazon. Netflix and HBO have released an expensive bomb every year (often more than once a year). The biggest challenge in assessing the performance of Amazon’s studio is that the company’s goals are different than those of most entertainment companies. While Amazon executives do measure the number of people who watch their shows, the video business exists to attract customers to the company’s Prime shipping service. The company often tries to determine if a show has increased the number of people who pay for Prime or take some other “highly valued action.” The metrics to prove this are imprecise. Amazon has seen enough, however, to increase the video programming budget from year to year. While executives and agents used to wonder if tech giants Amazon and Apple would wake up one day and decide to give up on entertainment, that’s not going to happen. Amazon is investing  more money in original movies and has committed to show football into the next decade.  But the tolerance for mistakes isn’t what it used to be at any company, not even Amazon or Apple. The first indication Amazon was going to pay closer attention to costs came in 2020, when the company brought in Mike Hopkins to oversee its video business, including the studio. The former CEO of Hulu, Hopkins is a veteran media executive who cut his teeth at Fox. Though he has little experience on the creative side, Hopkins is very familiar with an income statement. He has tried to rein in production costs, leading to occasional disputes with Salke. He also pushed for the company’s $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM, a price that shocked many in Hollywood. After a recent trip to Seattle, where Amazon is based, Salke told her staff that her bosses had raved about the performance of the studio’s team. Yet even as Jassy voices his support, he wants to know where all the money is going.   Taylor Swift is bringing in ticket sales of more than   $13 million a night on the road — putting her on a trajectory to deliver the highest-grossing tour in music history.   Most of the money goes toward the cost of production, and that sum doesn’t include the additional millions of dollars in merchandise sales that the Eras tour is generating. But it still makes Swift, 33, the top-grossing artist in the world and marks the biggest tour of her career.   Two months ago, I wrote that Swift could be on pace for the first tour to gross $1 billion. That is now inevitable. Swift grossed $300 million from her first 22 dates. She was scheduled to perform more than 50 dates in the US in all and then go abroad. Pollstar estimates Eras could top $1.3 billion.   You can read more on the success of Swift’s tour   here. But I want to draw attention to ticket prices.   The average ticket to a Swift show costs $253. That is more than double the cost of her previous tour; the cost of seeing Taylor Swift has increased by $134 in just five years.   Seven of the 25 best-selling acts of the first half of the year are charging more than $200 a night. That includes Bruce Springsteen ($223), Suga ($218) and George Strait ($281!). Just five years ago, the only two tours that topped $200 were Britney Spears and Celine Dion. The year’s biggest tour (Ed Sheeran) cost just $89 a night.   The average price of the 25 best-selling tours has jumped by $37 in just five years. (Adjusted for inflation the jump is only about $13.60.) You can see what’s happened if you group it into tiers.    Almost every ticket used to cost between $75 and $130. Now there are more top acts charging upward of $200 than there are top performers charging less than $100.  Media company profits fall by 89%    Last week I published a chart showing the rapid decline in profit at the world’s largest entertainment companies. The numbers are worse than I wrote at the time; I revised them using a better dataset:   From $23.4 billion in 2013 to $2.6 billion.  Netflix axes the cheapest plan    Netflix is getting rid of basic, its cheapest plan, in Canada. Existing customers can still renew, but new subscribers who want a lower price point must sign up for the advertising-supported tier.   It is only a matter of time before Netflix rolls this out in the US; it has already hidden the basic offering on sign-up pages.   Basic is Netflix’s least lucrative tier. Though the advertising-supported plan is the cheapest, the company makes about as much money from that one as it does from its most popular plan ($15.49).  TikTok goes shopping    TikTok is going to launch an online retail store, according to Semafor. This is different than the feature that allows brands to sell their products within the short-form video app.   Social video companies keep trying to make commerce happen. Will this work?

      "['Mark Zuckerberg is feeling the heat in China — again. An influential social media account affiliated with the official Beijing Daily on Wednesday raked the Meta Platforms Inc. founder over the coals for his previous criticisms of Chinese censorship and alleged intellectual property theft. The lengthy editorial emerged after the Wall Street Journal reportedBloomberg Terminal Meta was in talks with Tencent Holdings Ltd. about helping sell the Quest VR headset in China, despite a block on its mainstay social media services from Facebook to Instagram. Zuckerberg “dropped a rock on his own foot,” the Beijing Daily said in a WeChat post that garnered more than 100,000 views. “You smashed the wok, and now you want to enjoy a Chinese meal?” Zuckerberg’s relationship with China has run hot and cold. The Meta CEO was famously pictured jogging through a smog-filled Beijing and greeting then internet-czar Lu Wei at the height of a campaign to court officials in the world’s largest internet arena.  That courtship soured after Lu was jailed for alleged corruption, and a backlash emerged in the US against internet firms’ endeavors to gain access to China. The entrepreneur has since slammed ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok — now a fierce rival — for privacy violations and the alleged scrubbing of content. Zuckerberg has also accused China publicly of technology theft. US officials are currently reviewing TikTok and could potentially ban the short video app on national security grounds. Representatives for Meta and Tencent didn’t respond to requests for comment. The South China Morning Post first reported on the editorial. “Zuckerberg is now searching for a better solution to his China problem,” the editorial ran. “But the biggest hurdle to that may be himself.”']\n",

      "['Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and investment firm SBI Holdings Inc. are teaming up to build a foundry in Japan to meet growing demand by manufacturers to source chips locally. SBI will help raise funds for the new venture, which plans to begin with 40-nanometer and 55nm automotive and industrial chips and produce more advanced 28nm chips in the medium-to-longterm, according to SBI President Yoshitaka Kitao. Details on the timing and location of the factory remain undecided, he said at a news conference Wednesday. The world’s leading contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is building a plant in southwest Japan expected to go online as early as next year.  “The most important thing is how they will recover their investment,” said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan Inc. Shares in SBI closed up 2% after the announcement, while Powerchip rose 2.3%. Tokyo-based SBI is eyeing the growing financing needs of chipmakers to create redundant production lines as manufacturers bow to political and investor pressure to diversify their suppliers. SBI will help the chip venture raise funds globally and consider measures including issuing municipal bonds and securing Japanese regional bank loans. “Our priority is Japan,” Powerchip Chairman Frank Huang said, noting that the weak yen, lower labor costs and favorable financing now make Japan attractive as a production site. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is betting shifting geopolitical priorities will help Japan regain some of its long-lost leadership in semiconductors. Japan’s preparing billions of dollars in subsidies as part of a push to triple domestic production of chips by 2030. Such efforts are not enough, Kitao said. “The government has spent ¥2 trillion over the past two years to develop domestic chip manufacturing capacity, but I think that’s too little,” Kitao said. “We want to help revive Japan’s chip industry.”']\n",

      "['A lineup of post-pandemic music concerts, from Coldplay to Blackpink, has driven more Indonesians to turn to fintech lending to get quick funds. Outstanding loans from digital platforms reached 51.5 trillion rupiah ($3.4 billion) in May, up 28% from a year ago, according to the Financial Services Authority, or OJK. Now the regulator is warning borrowers to be wary and not to borrow beyond their means. Read More: Jokowi Declares Five-Day Weekend to Get Indonesians Spending “Most of those who have difficulty paying off loans usually borrow for consumer needs, for example buying new gadgets, recreation, fashion, and even recently to buy concert tickets,” OJK Commissioner Friderica Widyasari Dewi said in a briefing Tuesday. Smartphone penetration is outpacing the growth of banking access in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, enabling internet-based financial services to grow rapidly as an alternative to conventional lenders to help small businesses get funds to expand. But more than half of outstanding loans are still concentrated in Jakarta and the neighboring West Java, and only about 40% of the funds go to small businesses. The ratio of bad online loans – credit that borrowers don’t pay back for more than 90 days from maturity — also rose to 3.36% in May, from 2.78% at the end of 2022, even if it’s still below the 5% threshold set by the regulator. “We continue to advise people to understand the risks of online lending, especially the dangers of illegal fintech,” said Dewi.

As clients demand more for less, law firms are hiring growing numbers of staff who’ve studied technology not tort law to try and stand out from their rivals.  Law firms are advertising for experts in artificial intelligence “more than ever before,” says Chris Tart-Roberts, head of the legal technology practice at Macfarlanes, describing a trend he says began about six months ago.  “Competition for lawtech talent is fierce and has been for some time.” The revolution in generative AI, machine learning that can make predictions, has accelerated the legal industry’s search for more effective technology. Many firms are now putting together teams to figure out how to use generative AI across all their practice areas even as ChatGPT, the chatbot owned by OpenAI, becomes something to be feared as well as embraced.  Read more: Will AI Take My Job? It’s the Hot Topic This Summer: MLIV Pulse Legal services are the most vulnerable to ChatGPT-style software, according to a recent University of Pennsylvania study. That’s fueling concerns AI could replace a significant chunk of junior lawyer drudgery. The widely-accessible technology is particularly suited to time-consuming legal work, because of its ability to instantly analyze large documents, predict successful arguments based on past cases or create questions based on pre-defined criteria for a deposition.  Allen & Overy earlier this year was the first of the Magic Circle of top UK law firms to announce a chatbot to help lawyers draft contracts and client memos. Rivals are now piloting legal AI ‘assistants’ like Casetext Inc.’s CoCounsel, including Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner which began a trial of the software in June.  Travers Smith, also based in London, says it recently promoted one of its software engineers to the role of AI manager and is looking to build a customized custom AI model for the firm. Liverpool-based Weightmans hired two junior legal-engineers this year to meet client demand for tech expertise, says Catriona Wolfenden, the firm’s innovation manager.  At Macfarlanes, one senior team member is now studying a master’s in AI at the University of Cambridge. Allen & Overy plans to add more data scientists to its 20-strong team of lawyers and developers who work on AI-powered software that can draft contract clauses or facilitate negotiations, says Francesca Bennetts, a partner at the firm.  “It’s an unmistakable trend,” says Christina Blacklaws, a legal consultant and chair of Lawtech UK, a government-backed project to transform the UK legal industry through technology. “A lot of this is driven by clients who want more for less: more transparency, more cost-effective legal services.” The changing jobs landscape is even changing law school curricula. The University of Liverpool now offers modules to teach students to interact with legal tech tools, according to Katie Atkinson, dean of the school of electrical engineering, electronics and computer science. “It’s not like all the lawyers are going to be replaced by data scientists,” says Atkinson. “It’s more like there’s a section of new roles coming in.” The Tech Behind Those Amazing, Flawed New Chatbots: QuickTake']\n"
